        value: >-
          <p><em>Wish</em> is the mightiest spell a mortal can cast. By simply
          speaking aloud, you can alter reality itself.</p><p>The basic use of
          this spell is to duplicate any other spell of level 8 or lower. If you
          use it this way, you don’t need to meet any requirements to cast that
          spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes
          effect.</p><p>Alternatively, you can create one of the following
          effects of your choice:</p><p><strong>Object Creation.</strong> You
          create one object of up to 25,000 GP in value that isn’t a magic item.
          The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it
          appears in an unoccupied space that you can see on the
          ground.</p><p><strong>Instant Health.</strong> You allow yourself and
          up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and
          you end all effects on them listed in the <em>Greater Restoration</em>
          spell.</p><p><strong>Resistance.</strong> You grant up to ten
          creatures that you can see Resistance to one damage type that you
          choose. This Resistance is permanent.</p><p><strong>Spell
          Immunity.</strong> You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity
          to a single spell or other magical effect for 8
          hours.</p><p><strong>Sudden Learning.</strong> You replace one of your
          feats with another feat for which you are eligible. You lose all the
          benefits of the old feat and gain the benefits of the new one. You
          can’t replace a feat that is a prerequisite for any of your other
          feats or features.</p><p><strong>Roll Redo.</strong> You undo a single
          recent event by forcing a reroll of any die roll made within the last
          round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to
          accommodate the new result. For example, a <em>Wish</em> spell could
          undo an ally’s failed saving throw or a foe’s Critical Hit. You can
          force the reroll to be made with Advantage or Disadvantage, and you
          choose whether to use the reroll or the original
          roll.</p><p><strong>Reshape Reality.</strong> You may wish for
          something not included in any of the other effects. To do so, state
          your wish to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great
          latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the
          wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell
          might simply fail, the effect you desire might be achieved only in
          part, or you might suffer an unforeseen consequence as a result of how
          you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead
          might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no
          longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly,
          wishing for a Legendary magic item or an Artifact might instantly
          transport you to the presence of the item’s current owner. If your
          wish is granted and its effects have consequences for a whole
          community, region, or world, you are likely to attract powerful foes.
          If your wish would affect a god, the god’s divine servants might
          instantly intervene to prevent it or to encourage you to craft the
          wish in a particular way. If your wish would undo the multiverse
          itself, threaten the City of Sigil, or affect the Lady of Pain in any
          way, you see an image of her in your mind for a moment; she shakes her
          head, and your wish fails.</p><p>The stress of casting <em>Wish</em>
          to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens
          you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you
          finish a Long Rest, you take 1d10 Necrotic damage per level of that
          spell. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. In
          addition, your Strength score becomes 3 for 2d4 days. For each of
          those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light
          activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally,
          there is a [[/r 1d3cs1]]{33 percent chance} that you are unable to
          cast <em>Wish</em> ever again if you suffer this stress.</p>

          <p>For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within
          30 feet of yourself. If you sense such effects, you can take the Magic
          action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in
          the area that bears the magic, and if an effect was created by a
          spell, you learn the spell’s school of magic.</p><p>The spell is
          blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin
          sheet of lead.</p>

          <p>Choose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within
          range. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner
          you choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s
          elevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or
          form a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the
          area’s largest dimension. For example, if you affect a 40-foot square,
          you can create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the
          square’s elevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep,
          and so on. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete. Because
          the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the area
          can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.</p><p>At
          the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell, you
          can choose a new area of terrain to affect within range.</p><p>This
          spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction. Rocks and
          structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the way you shape
          the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might
          collapse.</p><p>Similarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant
          growth. The moved earth carries any plants along with it.</p>

          <p>A passage appears at a point that you can see on a wooden, plaster,
          or stone surface (such as a wall, ceiling, or floor) within range and
          lasts for the duration. You choose the opening’s dimensions: up to 5
          feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage creates no
          instability in a structure surrounding it.</p><p>When the opening
          disappears, any creatures or objects still in the passage created by
          the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the
          surface on which you cast the spell.</p>

  - name: Wall of Stone
    system:
      description:
        value: >-
          <p>A nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point
          you choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed of
          ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with
          another panel. Alternatively, you can create 10-foot-by-20-foot panels
          that are only 3 inches thick.</p><p>If the wall cuts through a
          creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side
          of the wall (you choose which side). If a creature would be surrounded
          on all sides by the wall (or the wall and another solid surface), that
          creature can make a Dexterity saving throw. On a success, it can use
          its Reaction to move up to its Speed so that it is no longer enclosed
          by the wall.</p><p>The wall can have any shape you desire, though it
          can’t occupy the same space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t
          need to be vertical or rest on a firm foundation. It must, however,
          merge with and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can
          use this spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.</p><p>If you create
          a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve the size of each
          panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the wall to create
          battlements and the like.</p><p>The wall is an object made of stone
          that can be damaged and thus breached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 Hit
          Points per inch of thickness, and it has Immunity to Poison and
          Psychic damage. Reducing a panel to 0 Hit Points destroys it and might
          cause connected panels to collapse at the DM’s discretion.</p><p>If
          you maintain your Concentration on this spell for its full duration,
          the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled. Otherwise, the wall
          disappears when the spell ends.</p>
