        <h2>Instant Death</h2><p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When
        damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you
        die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point
        maximum.</p><p>For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points
        currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she
        is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining
        damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.</p><h2>Becoming
        Imperiled</h2><p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill
        you, you may choose to remain conscious and standing by gaining a level
        of exhaustion. If you do, you become
        <strong>@UUID[Compendium.sosly-5e-house-rules.house-rules.JournalEntry.OosZQsAJrULa2WcY.JournalEntryPage.wWUvr8XTV3xFqI4R]{Imperiled}</strong>
        instead of <strong>Dying.</strong></p><h3>Knocking Imperiled Creatures
        Unconscious</h3><p>When you make a melee attack against a creature, you
        can choose to deal non-lethal damage. If the creature would become
        Imperiled, they instead must make a Constitution saving throw, with a DC
        equal to the damage you dealt (minimum 10). On a failed saving throw,
        the creature becomes stable and unconscious. On a success, the creature
        becomes imperiled as normal.</p><h3>Stabilizing a Creature</h3><p>The
        best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing
        is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn't
        killed by a failed death saving throw.</p><p>You can use your action to
        administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize
        it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p><p>A
        stable creature doesn't make death saving throws, even though it has 0
        hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being
        stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any
        damage. A stable creature that isn't healed regains 1 hit point after
        1d4 hours.</p>

        <p>The following rules affect how your character moves about the
        battlefield.</p><h2>Gridless Movement</h2><p>Rather than using a grid,
        combat is played gridless. Your character can move in any direction, and
        if you can see it, so can your character, unless the DM says
        otherwise.</p><h2>Reach</h2><p>Reach is determined by measuring your
        character's reach from the center of your token. If you can touch a
        target within your character's reach, then you are in melee with that
        target. A creature larger than Medium size adds 5 feet for each size it
        is larger to determine if it is in melee with a target. A creature
        smaller than size small subtracts 2.5 feet from its reach to determine
        if it is in melee with a target.</p><h2>Jumping</h2><p>Long Jump. If the
        distance of your long jump would cost more than your remaining movement,
        then you end your turn in mid-air at the point in your jump where your
        speed would allow you to reach. At the start of your next turn, you
        complete the jump, expending any movement necessary to reach your
        destination.</p>

        <p>Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of
        the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat.
        They need rest--time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their
        minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further
        adventure.</p><p>Adventurers, as well as other creatures, can take a
        breather to catch their breath after a fight, a short rest in the midst
        or at the end of the day, and a long rest whenever they can take a bit
        of time away from adventuring.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>This house rule is
        long, so here's the short version:</p><ul><li><p>A Breather takes 5
        minutes, and can be used to regain hit points or spell
        slots.</p></li><li><p>A Short Rest takes 8 hours, and can be used to
        regain some hit dice and recover some abilities.</p></li><li><p>A Long
        Rest takes 24 hours, and can be used to regain all of your hit points
        and recover all of your abilities.</p></li></ul><h2>Breather</h2><p>A
        Breather is a period of brief rest—at least 5 minutes long. During a
        Breather, you stop to catch your breath, doing nothing more strenuous
        than eating, drinking, reading, or tending to
        wounds.</p><h4><strong>Benefits of the Rest</strong></h4><p>When you
        finish a Breather, you can spend one or more hit dice to gain any of the
        following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>For each Hit Die spent on
        <strong>healing</strong>, the player rolls the die and adds the
        character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit
        points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend
        an additional Hit Die after each roll. Characters who spend at least 1
        hit die during a breather can also gain the benefit of a Bard's
        <strong>Song of Rest</strong> feature, if there is a bard
        present.</p></li><li><p>For each Hit Die spent on <strong>regaining
        spell slots</strong>, you gain a pool of spell levels that can be used
        to regain expended spell slots. For example, to regain a 3rd level spell
        slot, you must expend 3 hit die on regaining spell
        slots.</p></li><li><p>For each Hit Die spent on <strong>rest</strong>,
        you can remove one level of
        exhaustion.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Interrupting the
        Rest</strong></h4><p>If your Breather is interrupted by combat or 1
        minute of walking, casting Spells, or similar activity, the rest confers
        no benefit and must be restarted.</p><h2>Short Rest</h2><p>A Short Rest
        is a period of downtime, at least 8 hours long, during which you sleep
        for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity,
        such as reading, talking, eating, or standing
        watch.</p><h4><strong>Benefits of the Rest</strong></h4><p>When you
        finish a Short Rest, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You
        recover any ability which normally recovers on a Short
        Rest.</p></li><li><p>You reduce your Exhaustion by 1.</p></li><li><p>You
        can change your list of prepared spells, if your class prepares
        spells.</p></li><li><p>You regain 1 hit
        die.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Interrupting the Rest</strong></h4><p>If
        your Short Rest is interrupted by combat or 1 hour of walking, casting
        spells, or similar activity, the rest confers no benefit and must be
        restarted; however, if the rest was at least 5 minutes long before the
        interruption, you gain the benefits of a
        Breather.</p><h4><strong>Failing to Rest</strong></h4><p>If your
        character does not complete a short rest within a given 24 hour period,
        they will begin to show signs of exhaustion. For every 8 hours that your
        character fails to complete a Short Rest after 24 hours, make a
        Constitution saving throw (DC 10, +1 for every time you make this roll
        after the first). On a failed save, you gain 1 level of
        @UUID[JournalEntry.1yj85LDANYEdkBEH.JournalEntryPage.mYtIiN0Nl4HFcQKM]{Exhaustion}.
        If you fail the roll by 5 or more, you gain 2 levels of
        Exhaustion.</p><h2>Long Rest</h2><p>A Long Rest is a period of extended
        downtime—at least 24 hours long—available to any creature. During a Long
        Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours, perform no more than 8 hours of
        downtime activity (described in <em>Xanathar's Guide to
        Everything</em>), and spend the rest of your time performing light
        activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing
        watch.</p><h4><strong>Benefits of the Rest</strong></h4><p>When you
        finish a Long Rest, you gain the following benefits:</p><ul><li><p>You
        regain all of your expended Hit Dice.</p></li><li><p>You regain all of
        your Hit Points.</p></li><li><p>You recover any ability which normally
        recovers on a Long or Short Rest.</p></li><li><p>If your Ability Scores
        were reduced, they return to normal.</p></li><li><p>You reduce your
        Exhaustion by a number equal to your your Constitution Modifier (minimum
        1).</p></li><li><p>You gain
        @UUID[JournalEntry.1yj85LDANYEdkBEH.JournalEntryPage.bVCnMndy9tOnbcg3]{Inspiration},
        if you don't already have it.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Interrupting the
        Rest</strong></h4><p>If your Long Rest is interrupted by combat or 1
        hour of walking, casting spells, or similar activity, the rest confers
        no benefit and must be restarted; however, if your character spent at
        least 6 hours sleeping during the Long Rest, your character gains the
        benefit of a Short Rest.</p>

        <p>Traditional druidic teachings hold that spellcasting requires speech
        and gestures impossible in animal form. These spells challenge that

        physicality.</p> <p>Each spell bears the <strong>Beast Form (B)</strong>
        component, meaning it can only be cast while Wild Shaped. The
        transformed body itself becomes the conduit for these primal magics—the
        beast form component cannot be replaced by any focus.</p> <p>A druid
        must prepare these spells during their normal preparation, choosing

        <p>The following rules modify the usual rules at character
        creation.</p><h2>Ability Scores (23/25/27)</h2><p>You generate your
        character’s six <strong>ability scores</strong> randomly, by rolling
        subtractions from a base stat array. The base stat array is 23, 25, and
        27. Before you make your first roll, declare the order in which you
        intend to use this array. You can choose to use the 23, the 25, or the
        27 in any order.</p><p>Once you have declared the order, roll four
        6-sided dice, and record the total of the highest three dice on a piece
        of scratch paper. Subtract this number from the first of your stat
        arrays, and record the result on your scratch paper. Repeat this process
        for the second and third number in the stat array. When you are
        finished, you will have six numbers which sum to a total of 75. If any
        of your rolls (or the score you get by subtracting your roll) is less
        than a 7 or greater than an 18, reroll that set.</p><p>Now, take your
        six numbers and write each number beside one of your character’s six
        abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,
        Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your
        ability scores as a result of your race
        choice.</p><blockquote><p><em><strong>Building Bruenor, Step
        3</strong></em></p><p><em>Bob decides to use the base stat order of 23,
        25, then 27, for Bruenor’s abilities. He rolls an 8, and then subtracts
        8 from 23 to get his second score of 15. He then rolls a 14, and then
        subtracts 14 from 25 to get his fouth score of 11. Finally, he rolls a
        13, then subtracts 13 from 27 to get his final score of
        14.</em></p><p><em>He now has the following numbers written down: (8,
        15, 14, 11, 13, 14). Since he’s a fighter, he puts his highest score,
        15, in Strength. His next-highest, 14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor
        might be a brash fighter, but Bob decides he wants the dwarf to be
        older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores in Wisdom and
        Charisma. After applying his racial benefits (increasing Bruenor’s
        Constitution by 2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor’s ability scores and
        modifiers look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 11 (+0),
        Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence 8 (-1), Wisdom 14 (+2), and Charisma
        13 (+1).</em></p><p><em>Bob fills in Bruenor’s final hit points: 10 +
        his Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit
        points.</em></p></blockquote><h2>Hit Points</h2><p>You begin play with
        the maximum number of hit points for your character at level 1. For each
        additional level, you must roll to determine your hit points for the new
        level. If you do not like your roll, you can ask the Dungeon Master to
        roll for you, but you must use the Dungeon Master's roll no matter
        what.</p><h2>Skill Points</h2><p>A character gains a number of skill
        points equal to their Intelligence modifier (minimum 0). These points
        can be spent to gain additional proficiencies. You can expend your
        points to gain one of the following benefits:</p><p><strong>1
        Point:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Gain proficiency in a Language, Weapon,
        Tool, or Vehicle of your choice.</p></li></ul><p><strong>2
        Points:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Gain expertise in a Tool or Vehicle that
        you are Proficient in, or</p></li><li><p>Gain proficiency in a Skill of
        your choice.</p></li></ul><p><strong>3
        Points:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Gain expertise in a Skill that you are
        Proficient in.</p></li></ul>

        <p>As a spellcaster with a class feature that uses a spellbook—such as a
        wizard—or as a character who can cast ritual spells, you may create your
        own spells through dedicated arcane research. This section presents
        rules for when you wish to modify existing spells or develop entirely
        new magical formulas.</p><h2>Designing the Spell</h2><p>Before beginning
        any research, you must first design your spell concept and consult with
        your DM for approval. This initial step is crucial whether you’re
        modifying an existing spell or creating something entirely
        new.</p><p>When designing a spell, consider the
        following:</p><p><strong>For Modified Spells.</strong> Your changes
        should present a clear tradeoff compared to the original—perhaps trading
        damage for range, duration for area of effect, or adding a secondary
        effect at the cost of reduced primary potency. While the modified spell
        should not be strictly superior to the original, minor improvements may
        be permitted at your DM’s discretion, especially if they align with your
        character’s specialization or narrative development.</p><p><strong>For
        New Spells</strong>. Your creation must either exactly reproduce an
        existing spell from the game (one you don’t already know) or follow the
        rules for
        @UUID[Compendium.dnd-dungeon-masters-guide.content.JournalEntry.dmgDmsToolbox000.JournalEntryPage.IIWDMn0sUtrnJFC2]{creating
        a spell} in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Consider how your spell fits
        your character’s class, level, and the campaign setting.</p><p>Only
        after your DM approves your spell design can you begin the actual
        research process.</p><h2>Research Process</h2><p>Creating or modifying a
        spell requires dedicated research time and arcane skill. You must spend
        time studying magical theory, experimenting with arcane energies, and
        gradually working toward a breakthrough.</p><p>For each 4-hour research
        session, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check. The DC for this check
        equals 11 + twice the spell’s level. For example, creating a 3rd-level
        spell requires checks against DC 17.</p><p>You must accumulate a certain
        number of successes before reaching a threshold of failures. Each
        success represents a breakthrough in understanding, while failures
        represent setbacks and dead ends in your research. A natural 20 on this
        check counts as two successes, while a natural 1 counts as two
        failures.</p><p>If you accumulate the required number of failures before
        achieving the necessary successes, your research reaches a dead end. You
        must gain a level before you can research that spell again, and you must
        start over from scratch.</p><h3>Modifying Existing
        Spells</h3><p>Modifying a spell already in your spellbook requires (3 +
        twice the spell’s level) successes before accumulating (3 + the spell’s
        level) failures. For example, modifying a 2nd-level spell requires 7
        successes before reaching 5 failures.</p><h3>Creating New
        Spells</h3><p>Creating an entirely new spell—or recreating one you’ve
        witnessed but don’t have in your spellbook—requires (3 + three times the
        spell’s level) successes before accumulating (3 + the spell’s level)
        failures. For instance, creating a 1st-level spell requires 6 successes
        before reaching 4 failures.</p><p>New spells often prove less efficient
        than their well-established counterparts; this reflects the experimental
        nature of magical innovation. You may later refine your creation using
        the spell modification rules once the base spell has been successfully
        created.</p><h2>Recording the Spell</h2><p>Unlike traditional spell
        copying, you record your research as you go, with each session
        contributing to the final spell formula in your spellbook. Each 4-hour
        research session costs you 10 gold pieces for materials such as rare
        inks, experimental components, and testing apparatus, and uses
        one-quarter of a page in your spellbook (always round up after your
        research is complete).</p><p>These costs apply whether the session
        results in success or failure. For example, if your research takes 16
        sessions to complete, the total cost would be 64 hours of time, 160 gold
        pieces, and 4 pages in your spellbook. Spells cannot take a partial
        page.</p><p>No additional time or cost is required to “record” the spell
        once research is complete; the final success represents your
        breakthrough in completing a functional magical formula.</p>
