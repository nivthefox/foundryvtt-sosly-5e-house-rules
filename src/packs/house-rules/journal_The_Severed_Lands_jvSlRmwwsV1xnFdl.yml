        <p><em>Variant Rule</em></p><p>When you cast a spell using a spell slot,
        you must expend blood equal to 3 hit points per level of the spell slot
        used. You can provide this blood in one of three
        ways:</p><p><strong>Direct Sacrifice.</strong> Take necrotic damage
        equal to the spell’s level × 1d6. This damage can’t be reduced or
        prevented and counts as the blood cost for the
        spell.</p><p><strong>Blood Vials.</strong> Expend stored blood from
        vials. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus
        action to collect blood equal to the damage dealt by the killing blow
        (maximum 30 hit points per vial). You can also fill vials during a rest
        by taking necrotic damage. Blood loses potency over time—after each long
        rest, halve the value of stored blood (round
        down).</p><p><strong>Sacrificial Casting.</strong> When you reduce a
        creature (other than a Construct, Undead, or Elemental) to 0 hit points
        with a weapon attack or cantrip, you can immediately cast a spell with a
        casting time of 1 action as part of the same action. The spell's level
        can't exceed the creature's Hit Dice.</p><p><strong>Wild Shape and Blood
        Magic.</strong> If you have the ability to cast spells while in a beast
        form, you must still sacrifice blood and suffer the effects of madness.
        Any blood vials you are carrying merge into your form; however, while
        merged into your form you become empowered by their essence and can
        expend the contents of those vials to empower your magic without having
        to draw from the vial directly. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit
        points, you can use a bonus action to increase the amount of blood
        empowering you as if you had filled another vial. When your shape change
        ends, the blood empowering you transfers back into any vials you are
        carrying. Blood in excess of the vials you are carrying is wasted, and
        covers your skin, instead.</p><h3>Madness</h3><p>Each time you cast a
        spell using a spell slot through blood magic, you must make a saving
        throw (DC = 10 + the spell’s level) using your Spellcasting ability
        score.</p><p>On a failed save, you may choose to gain a point of madness
        and suffer an effect on the Madness table (below), or you may choose to
        gain a point of Exhaustion, instead.</p><p><strong>Blood Surge.</strong>
        When you roll a natural 20 on your madness saving throw, the spell
        doesn’t consume a spell slot.</p><p><strong>Hungry Magic.</strong> When
        you roll a natural 1 on your madness saving throw, the blood magic
        hungers for more—the spell consumes an additional spell slot of the same
        level or lower (if available). If you do not have a spell slot to fuel
        the hunger, you instead take an additional 1d6 psychic damage for every
        spell level of the original spell.</p><p><strong>Recovery.</strong> When
        you finish a long rest, reduce your madness points by an amount equal to
        your proficiency bonus. This does not remove any lingering madness
        effects.</p><h4>Madness Effects</h4><p><strong>Short-Term
        Madness.</strong> The character has the Frightened, Incapacitated, or
        Stunned condition (chosen by the DM) for the duration. This condition
        might be accompanied by alarming behavior or hallucinations. These
        effects can be suppressed with the calm emotions spell or removed by the
        lesser restoration spell.</p><p><strong>Long-Term Madness.</strong> The
        character has Disadvantage on all ability checks for a specific ability
        score (chosen by the DM) for the duration, stemming from an
        unwillingness or inability to exert a particular set of abilities. The
        character might feel enervated and unable to exert much Strength, for
        example, or become so suspicious of others that Charisma checks are more
        difficult. These effects can be suppressed with the calm emotions spell
        or removed by the lesser restoration spell.</p><p><strong>Indefinite
        Madness.</strong> An indefinite effect is a long-term effect (see above)
        that lasts until removed by a greater restoration spell. It can be
        suppressed by a calm emotions
        spell.</p><h4>Madness</h4><table><tbody><tr><th><p>Madness

        <p><em>Optional Rule</em></p><p>This rule introduces consequences for severe damage, allowing characters to sustain long-term injuries instead of immediate death or exhaustion.</p><h3>When Injuries Occur</h3><p>Characters gain lingering injuries in three situations:</p><ul><li>Instead of gaining exhaustion from the Imperiled condition</li><li>Instead of counting a failed death save as successful</li><li>Instead of taking full damage from a critical hit</li></ul><h3>Recovery Mechanics</h3><p>Lingering injuries are intended to last, and will not heal with time alone. Recovery requires magical or psionic healing, or multiple long rests (varies by injury type). During long rests, a character needs a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check (DC 10) to progress toward recovery.</p><h3>Alternative Injuries</h3><p>Players may negotiate narrative injuries with their DM instead of using the table—such as permanent disadvantage from losing an eye or permanent limb loss. Recovery terms are determined collaboratively.</p><h3>Injury Table</h3><p>Roll on the @UUID[Compendium.sosly-5e-house-rules.effect-tables.RollTable.Gm1AesqOVcCfMYCi]{Lingering Injuries} table to determine the injury.</p><table><tbody><tr><th><p>d20</p></th><th><p>Injury</p></th><th><p>Effect</p></th><th><p>Recovery</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>1</p></td><td><p>Internal Hemorrhage</p></td><td><p>Lose 1d6 maximum hit points each day</p></td><td><p>Greater Restoration, Restore Vigor, or 4d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2</p></td><td><p>Internal Hemorrhage</p></td><td><p>Lose 1d6 maximum hit points each day</p></td><td><p>Greater Restoration, Restore Vigor, or 4d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>3</p></td><td><p>Shattered Bone</p></td><td><p>One limb unusable (DM chooses based on injury source)</p></td><td><p>Greater Restoration, Restore Vigor, or 4d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>4</p></td><td><p>Shattered Bone</p></td><td><p>One limb unusable (DM chooses based on injury source)</p></td><td><p>Greater Restoration, Restore Vigor, or 4d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>5</p></td><td><p>Nerve Damage</p></td><td><p>At start of your turn make a Constitution save (DC 15) or lose your Action</p></td><td><p>Lesser Restoration, Restore Health, or 3d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>6</p></td><td><p>Nerve Damage</p></td><td><p>At start of your turn make a Constitution save (DC 15) or lose your Action</p></td><td><p>Lesser Restoration, Restore Health, or 3d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>7</p></td><td><p>Torn Ligament</p></td><td><p>Speed halved</p></td><td><p>Lesser Restoration, Restore Health, or 3d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>8</p></td><td><p>Hideous Scar</p></td><td><p>Disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks, advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks</p></td><td><p>Lesser Restoration, Restore Health, or 2d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>9</p></td><td><p>Blood Loss</p></td><td><p>Gain 1 level of exhaustion that can't be removed</p></td><td><p>Any psionic or magical healing or 2d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>Traumatic Shock</p></td><td><p>One ability score is reduced by 1d4</p></td><td><p>Any psionic or magical healing or 2d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>11</p></td><td><p>Traumatic Shock</p></td><td><p>One ability score is reduced by 1d4</p></td><td><p>Any psionic or magical healing or 2d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>12</p></td><td><p>Traumatic Shock</p></td><td><p>One ability score is reduced by 1d4</p></td><td><p>Any psionic or magical healing or 2d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>13</p></td><td><p>Concussed</p></td><td><p>Disadvantage on Initiative</p></td><td><p>Any psionic or magical healing, or 2d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>14</p></td><td><p>Concussed</p></td><td><p>Disadvantage on Initiative</p></td><td><p>Any psionic or magical healing, or 2d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>15</p></td><td><p>Bruised Ribs</p></td><td><p>Speed reduced by 5 ft</p></td><td><p>Any psionic or magical healing, or 1d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>16</p></td><td><p>Bruised Ribs</p></td><td><p>Speed reduced by 5 ft</p></td><td><p>Any psionic or magical healing, or 1d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>17</p></td><td><p>Black Eye</p></td><td><p>Disadvantage on Perception checks</p></td><td><p>Any psionic or magical healing, or 1d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>18</p></td><td><p>Black Eye</p></td><td><p>Disadvantage on Perception checks</p></td><td><p>Any psionic or magical healing, or 1d6 long rests</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>19</p></td><td><p>Minor Scar</p></td><td><p>No mechanical effect</p></td><td><p>Permanent</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>20</p></td><td><p>Minor Scar</p></td><td><p>No mechanical effect</p></td><td><p>Permanent</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
