        <p><em>Variant Rule</em></p><p>When you cast a spell using a spell slot,
        you must expend blood equal to 3 hit points per level of the spell slot
        used. You can provide this blood in one of three
        ways:</p><p><strong>Direct Sacrifice.</strong> Take necrotic damage
        equal to the spell’s level × 1d6. This damage can’t be reduced or
        prevented and counts as the blood cost for the
        spell.</p><p><strong>Blood Vials.</strong> Expend stored blood from
        vials. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you can use a bonus
        action to collect blood equal to the damage dealt by the killing blow
        (maximum 30 hit points per vial). You can also fill vials during a rest
        by taking necrotic damage. Blood loses potency over time—after each long
        rest, halve the value of stored blood (round
        down).</p><p><strong>Sacrificial Casting.</strong> When you reduce a
        creature (other than a Construct, Undead, or Elemental) to 0 hit points
        with a weapon attack or cantrip, you can immediately cast a spell with a
        casting time of 1 action as part of the same action. The spell’s level
        can’t exceed the creature’s Hit Dice.</p><h3>Madness</h3><p>Each time
        you cast a spell using a spell slot through blood magic, you must make a
        saving throw (DC = 10 + the spell’s level) using your Spellcasting
        ability score.</p><p>On a failed save, you may choose to gain a point of
        madness and suffer an effect on the Madness table (below), or you may
        choose to gain a point of Exhaustion, instead.</p><p><strong>Blood
        Surge.</strong> When you roll a natural 20 on your madness saving throw,
        the spell doesn’t consume a spell slot.</p><p><strong>Hungry
        Magic.</strong> When you roll a natural 1 on your madness saving throw,
        the blood magic hungers for more—the spell consumes an additional spell
        slot of the same level or lower (if available). If you do not have a
        spell slot to fuel the hunger, you instead take an additional 1d6
        psychic damage for every spell level of the original
        spell.</p><p><strong>Recovery.</strong> When you finish a long rest,
        reduce your madness points by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.
        This does not remove any lingering madness effects.</p><h4>Madness
        Effects</h4><p><strong>Short-Term Madness.</strong> The character has
        the Frightened, Incapacitated, or Stunned condition (chosen by the DM)
        for the duration. This condition might be accompanied by alarming
        behavior or hallucinations. These effects can be suppressed with the
        calm emotions spell or removed by the lesser restoration
        spell.</p><p><strong>Long-Term Madness.</strong> The character has
        Disadvantage on all ability checks for a specific ability score (chosen
        by the DM) for the duration, stemming from an unwillingness or inability
        to exert a particular set of abilities. The character might feel
        enervated and unable to exert much Strength, for example, or become so
        suspicious of others that Charisma checks are more difficult. These
        effects can be suppressed with the calm emotions spell or removed by the
        lesser restoration spell.</p><p><strong>Indefinite Madness.</strong> An
        indefinite effect is a long-term effect (see above) that lasts until
        removed by a greater restoration spell. It can be suppressed by a calm
        emotions spell.</p><h4>Madness</h4><table><tbody><tr><th><p>Madness
