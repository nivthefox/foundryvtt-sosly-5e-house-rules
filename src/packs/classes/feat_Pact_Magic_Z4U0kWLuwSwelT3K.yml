    value: >-
      <p>Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious
      entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its
      identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast
      spells.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You know two Warlock
      cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can
      replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Warlock
      cantrip of your choice.</p><p>When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you
      learn another Warlock cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips
      column of the Warlock Features table.</p><p><em><strong>Spell
      Slots.</strong></em> The Warlock Features table shows how many spell slots
      you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The table also shows
      the level of those slots, all of which are the same level. You regain all
      expended Pact Magic spell slots when you finish a Short or Long
      Rest.</p><p>For example, when you’re a level 5 Warlock, you have two level
      3 spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell Witch Bolt, you must spend one of
      those slots, and you cast it as a level 3
      spell.</p><p><em><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong></em> You
      prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast
      with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells.</p><p>The
      number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock levels, as
      shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock Features table.
      Whenever that number increases, choose additional Warlock spells until the
      number of spells on your list matches the number in the table. The chosen
      spells must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot
      Level column for your level. When you reach level 6, for example, you
      learn a new Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.</p><p>If another
      Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those
      spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this
      feature, but those spells otherwise count as Warlock spells for
      you.</p><p><em><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.</strong></em>
      Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one spell on your list
      with another Warlock spell of an eligible
      level.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Charisma is
      the spellcasting ability for your Warlock
      spells.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong></em> You can use an
      Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.</p><p></p>
