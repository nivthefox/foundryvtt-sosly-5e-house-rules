      <p>As a student of psionics, you can master and use psionic talents and
      disciplines, the rules for which appear at the end of this document.
      Psionics is a special form of magic use, distinct from
      spellcasting.</p><p><em><strong>Talents.</strong></em> You know two
      talents of your choice. Whenever you gain a Psionicist level, you can
      replace one of your talents from this feature with another talent of your
      choice.</p><p>When you reach Psionicist levels 4 and 10, you learn another
      talent of your choice, as shown in the Talents column of the Psionicist
      Features table.</p><p><em><strong>Disciplines.</strong></em> A psionic
      discipline is a rigid set of mental exercises that allows a psionicist to
      manifest psionic power. At 1st level, you know two psionic disciplines of
      your choice. Whenever you gain a Psionicist level, you can replace one of
      your disciplines with another discipline of your choice.</p><p>The number
      of disciplines you know increases as you gain Psionicist levels, as shown
      in the Disciplines column of the Psionicist Features
      table.</p><p><em><strong>Power Points.</strong></em> You have an internal
      reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic disciplines you know.
      This energy is represented by power points. Each discipline describes
      effects you can create with it by spending a certain number of power
      points. A talent requires no power points.</p><p>The number of power
      points you have is based on your psionicist level, as shown in the Power
      Points column of the Psionicist Features table. The number shown for your
      level is your Power Point maximum. You regain all expended power points
      when you finish a long rest.</p><p><em><strong>Power Limit.</strong></em>
      Though you have access to a potent amount of psionic energy, it takes
      training and practice to channel that energy. There is a limit on the
      number of power points you can spend to activate a psionic discipline. The
      limit is based on your psionicist level, as shown in the Power Limit
      column of the Psionicist Features table.</p><p><em><strong>Psychic
      Focus.</strong></em> You can focus psionic energy on one of your
      disciplines to draw ongoing benefits from it. As a bonus action, you can
      choose oen of your disciplines an dgain its psychic focus benefit, which
      is detailed in that disciplien’s description. The benefit lasts until you
      are incapacitated or until you use another bonus action to choose a
      different focus benefit.</p><p>You can have only one psychic focus benefit
      at a time, and using the psychic focus of one discipline doesn’t limit
      your ability to use other disciplines.</p><p><em><strong>Psionics
      Ability.</strong></em> Intelligence is your manifestation ability for your
      psionic talents and disciplines.</p>
