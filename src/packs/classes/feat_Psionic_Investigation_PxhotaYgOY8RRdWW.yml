      <p>You can focus your mind to read the psionic imprint left on an object.
      If you hold an object and concentrate on it for 10 minutes (as if
      concentrating on a psionic discipline), you learn a few basic facts about
      it. You gain a mental image from the object's point of view, showing the
      last creature to hold the object within the past 24 hours.</p><p>You also
      learn of any events that have occurred within 20 feet of the object within
      the past hour. The events you perceive unfold from the object's
      perspective. You see and hear such events as if you were there, but can't
      use other senses.</p><p>Additionally, you can embed an intangible psionic
      sensor within the object. For the next 24 hours, you can use an action to
      learn the object's location relative to you (its distance and direction)
      and to look at the object's surroundings from its point of view as if you
      were there. This perception lasts until the start of your next
      turn.</p><p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you
      finish a short or long rest.</p>
