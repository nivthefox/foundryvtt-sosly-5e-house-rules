      <p>Your magic springs from a mystical link between your soul and the magic
      of elemental earth. You might trace a distant ancestor to the Plane of
      Earth, or your family might have earned a mighty boon in return for a
      service to the dao lords. Whatever your past, the magic of elemental earth
      is yours to command.</p><p>Your link to earth magic grants you
      extraordinary resilience, and stone sorcerers have a natural affinity for
      combat. A steel blade feels like a natural extension of your body, and
      sorcerers with this origin have a knack for wielding both shields and
      weapons. In combat your place is amid the fray. You rely on your elemental
      nature to shield you from harm and your magic and metal weapons to
      overwhelm your foes.</p><p><em><strong>Bonus Proficiencies.</strong></em>
      At 1st level, you gain proficiency with shields, simple weapons, and
      martial weapons.</p><p><em><strong>Stone's Durability. </strong></em>At
      1st level, your connection to stone gives you extra fortitude. Your hit
      point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you
      gain a level in this class.</p><p>As an action, you can gain a base AC of
      13 + your Constitution modifier if you aren’t wearing armor, and your skin
      assumes a stony appearance. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus
      action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a
      shield.</p><p><em><strong>Stone Aegis.</strong></em> Starting at 6th
      level, your command of earth magic grows stronger, allowing you to harness
      it for your allies’ protection.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can grant an
      aegis to one allied creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The aegis
      is a dim, gray aura of earth magic that protects the target. Any
      bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 2
      + your sorcerer level divided by 4. This effect lasts for 1 minute, until
      you use it again, or until you are incapacitated.</p><p>In addition, when
      a creature you can see within 60 feet of you hits the protected target
      with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to teleport to an
      unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the attacker. You can
      teleport only if you and the attacker are on the same surface. You can
      then make one melee weapon attack against the attacker. If that attack
      hits, it deals an extra 1d10 force damage. This extra damage increases to
      2d10 at 11th level and 3d10 at 17th level.</p><p><em><strong>Stone's Edge.
      </strong></em>Starting at 14th level, your mastery of earth magic allows
      you to add the force of elemental earth to your spells. When you cast a
      spell that deals damage, choose one creature damaged by that spell on the
      round you cast it. That creature takes extra force damage equal to half
      your sorcerer level. This feature can be used only once per casting of a
      spell.</p><p><em><strong>Earth Master's Aegis. </strong></em>Beginning at
      18th level, when you use your Stone’s Aegis to protect an ally, you can
      choose up to three creatures to gain its benefits.</p>
