    value: >-
      <p>With your patronâ€™s guidance you have learned to master a spell such
      that you can cast it at will. Choose a level 1 or level 2 spell that you
      have prepared and has a casting time of an action. You can cast that spell
      at its lowest level without expending a spell slot. If you want to cast it
      at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot at normal.</p><p>Whenever
      you finish a Long Rest, you can study and exchange your spell for another
      eligible spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p><p></p>
