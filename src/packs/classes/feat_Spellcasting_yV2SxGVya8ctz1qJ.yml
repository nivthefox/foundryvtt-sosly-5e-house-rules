    value: >-
      <p>Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast
      spells.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You know four Sorcerer
      cantrips of your choice. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can
      replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Sorcerer
      cantrip of your choice.</p><p>When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you
      learn another Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips
      column of the Sorcerer Features table.</p><p><em><strong>Spell
      Slots.</strong></em> The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell
      slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots
      when you finish a Long Rest.</p><p><em><strong>Prepared Spells of Level
      1+.</strong></em> You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are
      available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1
      Sorcerer spells.</p><p>The number of spells on your list increases as you
      gain Sorcerer levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the
      Sorcerer Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
      Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number
      in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must be of a level for
      which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Sorcerer,
      your list of prepared spells can include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or
      2 in any combination.</p><p>If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells
      that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number
      of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
      count as Sorcerer spells for you.</p><p><em><strong>Changing Your Prepared
      Spells.</strong></em> Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace
      one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have
      spell slots.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em>
      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer
      spells.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong></em> You can use an
      Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.</p>
