      <p>You have learned more secrets about the nuances of life and death.
      Immediately after you become Bloodied but aren't killed outright from
      taking damage, you can take a Reaction to reduce an Undead creature under
      your control that you can see to 0 Hit Points. You then immediately regain
      a number of Hit Points equal to your Wizard level.</p>
