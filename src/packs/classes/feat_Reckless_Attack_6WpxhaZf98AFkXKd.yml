    value: >-
      <p>You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased
      ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can
      decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls
      using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against
      you have Advantage during that time.</p><p></p>
