      learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast
      spells.</span></p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots. </strong></em><span
      style="font-family:Roboto, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Ranger Features
      table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells.
      You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</span></p><p><em><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong></em>
      You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast
      with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells.</p><p>The
      number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as
      shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever
      that number increases, choose additional Ranger spells until the number of
      spells on your list matches the number in the Ranger Features table. The
      chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For
      example, if you’re a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can
      include six Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.</p><p>If
      another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared,
      those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with
      this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for
      you.</p><p><em><strong>Changing Your Prepared Spells.
      </strong></em>Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one spell
      on your list with another Ranger spell for which you have spell
      slots.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability. </strong></em>Wisdom is
      your spellcasting ability for your Ranger
      spells.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong></em> You can use a
      Druidic Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.</p>
