  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden knowledge
      that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other lessons. You gain
      one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of the Tome. Invocations are
      described in the “Eldritch Invocation Options”
      section.</p><p><em><strong>Prerequisites.</strong></em> If an invocation
      has a prerequisite, you must meet it to learn that invocation. For
      example, if an invocation requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can
      select the invocation once you reach Warlock level
      5.</p><p><em><strong>Replacing and Gaining Invocations.</strong></em>
      Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your invocations
      with another one for which you qualify. You can’t replace an invocation if
      it’s a prerequisite for another invocation that you have.</p><p>When you
      gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of your choice, as
      shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock Features table.</p><p>You
      can’t pick the same invocation more than once unless its description says
      otherwise.</p><p></p>
