    value: >-
      <p>You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it
      to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense,
      which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel
      Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity,
      you choose which effect from this class to create.</p><p>You can use this
      class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when
      you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish
      a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level
      11.</p><p>If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC
      equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting
      feature.</p><p><em><strong>Otherworldly Sense.</strong></em> As a Bonus
      Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and
      Elementals. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated
      condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60
      feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius,
      you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been
      consecrated or desecrated, as with the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.spells.Item.SLxA9QhrggTz0taU]{Hallow} spell.</p>
