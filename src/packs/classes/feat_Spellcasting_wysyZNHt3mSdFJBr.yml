    value: >-
      <p>You have learned to cast spells through your bardic
      arts.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips.</strong></em> You know two cantrips of
      your choice from the Bard spell list.</p><p>Whenever you gain a Bard
      level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your
      choice from the Bard spell list.</p><p>When you reach Bard levels 4 and
      10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell list, as
      shown in the Cantrips column of the Bard Features
      table.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em> The Bard Features
      table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells.
      You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><em><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong></em> You
      prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast
      with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard
      spell list.</p><p>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain
      Bard levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard Features
      table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the
      Bard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number
      on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have
      spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Bard, your list of prepared
      spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any
      combination.</p><p>If another Bard feature gives you spells that you
      always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of
      spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count
      as Bard spells for you.</p><p><em><strong>Changing Your Prepared
      Spells.</strong></em> Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one
      spell on your list with another Bard spell for which you have spell
      slots.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Charisma is
      your spellcasting ability for your Bard
      spells.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong></em> You can use a
      Musical Instrument as a Spellcasting Focus for your Bard
      spells.</p><p></p>
