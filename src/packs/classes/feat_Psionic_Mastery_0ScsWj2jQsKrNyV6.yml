      <p>Your mastery of psionic energy allows you to push your mind beyond its
      normal limmits. On your turn, you can manifest any number of discipline
      abilities with a single action, as long as their total point cost is 9 or
      less.</p><p>You can use this feature once, and regain all expended uses
      when you finish a long rest. You gain additional uses when you reach
      certain Psionicist levels, as shown in the Psionic Mastery column of the
      Psionicist Features table.</p><p></p>
