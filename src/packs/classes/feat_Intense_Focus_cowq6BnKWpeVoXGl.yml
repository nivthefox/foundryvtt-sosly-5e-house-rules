    value: >-
      <p>When you manifest multiple abilities using psionic mastery, you can
      continue to concentrate on each of those effects. Using this ability to
      concentrate on an effect ends any effect you were already concentrating
      on, and if you begin concentrating on a new effect, the effects you are
      concentrating on from this ability end. When you take damage, you only
      make one concentration throw for any effects you are concentrating on with
      this ability, and if you fail you lose concentration on all of these
      effects.</p><p></p>
