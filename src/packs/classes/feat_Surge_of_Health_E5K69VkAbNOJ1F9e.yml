      <p>You can draw on your psychic focus to escape death's grasp. As a reaction when you take damage, you can halve that damage against you. Your psychic focus immediately ends if it's active, and you can't use it until you finish a short or long rest.</p><p>You can't use this feature if you can't use your psychic focus.</p>
