    value: >-
      <p>Your mastery as a rider becomes apparent. You have advantage on saving
      throws made to avoid falling off your mount. If you fall off your mount
      and descend no more than 10 feet, you can land on your feet if youâ€™re not
      incapacitated.</p><p>Finally, mounting or dismounting a creature costs you
      only 5 feet of movement, rather than half your speed.</p>
