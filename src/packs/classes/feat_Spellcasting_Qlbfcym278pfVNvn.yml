      <p>You have learned to cast spells through prayer and
      meditation.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Slots.</strong></em> The Paladin
      Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+
      spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long
      Rest.</p><p><em><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong></em> You
      prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast
      with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells.</p><p>The
      number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as
      shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table.
      Whenever that number increases, choose additional Paladin spells until the
      number of spells on your list matches the number in the Paladin Features
      table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell
      slots. For example, if you’re a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared
      spells can include six Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any
      combination.</p><p>If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you
      always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of
      spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count
      as Paladin spells for you.</p><p><em><strong>Changing Your Prepared
      Spells.</strong></em> Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one
      spell on your list with another Paladin spell for which you have spell
      slots.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em> Charisma is
      your spellcasting ability for your Paladin
      spells.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong></em> You can use a
      Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.</p>
