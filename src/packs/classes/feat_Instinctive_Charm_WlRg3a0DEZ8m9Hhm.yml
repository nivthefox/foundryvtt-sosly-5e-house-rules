    value: >-
      <p>When a creature within 30 feet of you hits you with an attack roll, you
      can take a Reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw
      against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attack misses instead,
      and if there is another creature within range of the attack other than the
      attacker, the attacker targets that creature with the triggering attack,
      using the same attack roll. If multiple creatures are within the attack's
      range, you choose which one to target.</p><p>Once you use this Reaction,
      you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore
      your use of it by casting an Enchantment spell with a spell slot.</p>
