      <p>An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an
      indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font of magic,
      whatever its origin, fuels your spells. See chapter 10 of the Player’s
      Handbook for the general rules of spellcasting, and chapter 11 for the
      sorcerer spell list.</p><p><em><strong>Cantrips. </strong></em>At 1st
      level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the sorcerer spell list.
      You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
      shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Sorcerer
      table.</p><p><em><strong>Strain. </strong></em>You do not have a pool of
      spell slots from which to cast your spells. Instead, as the raw magic of
      your spells course through you, you must strain to channel and shape the
      magic. As the strain builds up, it warps and twists your body. As part of
      casting a spell of 1st-level or higher (or using an ability which requires
      a spell slot) you gain an amount of strain to create a spell slot of a
      given level, and then use that slot to cast the spell. Cantrips don’t
      require spell slots, and thus don’t cause strain.</p><p>The amount of
      strain you can endure is limited based on your level as a Sorcerer, as
      shown in the strain limit column of the sorcerer table. You cannot cast a
      spell if it would result in you gaining strain in excess of this limit.
      You reduce your strain to 0 when you finish a long rest. Your level also
      determines the maximum-level spell you can cast. You cannot create a spell
      slot which exceeds this level, even if it would not exceed your strain
      limit.</p><p><em><strong>Prepared Spells of Level 1+.</strong></em> You
      know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer spell
      list.</p><p>The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you
      learn more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of
      a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd
      level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd
      level.</p><p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can
      choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another
      spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for
      which you have spell slots.</p><p><em><strong>Changing Your Prepared
      Spells.</strong></em> Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you can replace
      one spell on your list with another Sorcerer spell for which you have
      spell slots.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong></em>
      Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer
      spells.</p><p><em><strong>Spellcasting Focus.</strong></em> You can use an
      Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.</p>
