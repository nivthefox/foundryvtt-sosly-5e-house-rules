    value: >-
      <p>You have an internal reservoir of energy that can be devoted to psionic
      disciplines you know. This energy is represented by power points. Each
      discipline describes effects you can create with it by spending a certain
      number of power points. A talent requires no power points.</p><p>The
      number of power points you have is based on your psionicist level, as
      shown in the Power Points column of the Psionicist Features table. The
      number shown for your level is your Power Point maximum. You regain all
      expended power points when you finish a long rest.</p><p></p>
