      <p>You can fend off strikes directed at you, your mount, or other
      creatures nearby. If you or a creature you can see within 5 feet of you is
      hit by an attack, you can roll 1d8 as a reaction if you’re wielding a
      melee weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the
      target’s AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has
      resistance against the attack’s damage.</p><p>You can use this feature a
      number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and
      you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>
