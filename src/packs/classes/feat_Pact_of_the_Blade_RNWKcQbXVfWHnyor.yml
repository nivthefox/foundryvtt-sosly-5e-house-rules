    value: >-
      <p>As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand—a Simple
      or Martial Melee weapon of your choice with which you bond—or create a
      bond with a magic weapon you touch; you can’t bond with a magic weapon if
      someone else is attuned to it or another Warlock is bonded with it. Until
      the bond ends, you have proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as
      a Spellcasting Focus.</p><p>Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon,
      you can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead
      of using Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal
      Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.</p><p>Your
      bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature’s Bonus Action again, if
      the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, or if
      you die. A conjured weapon disappears when the bond ends.</p><p></p>
