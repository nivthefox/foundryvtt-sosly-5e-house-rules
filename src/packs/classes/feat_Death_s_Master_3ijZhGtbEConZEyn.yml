      <p>Abstruse rituals within your spellbook allow you mastery over forces of
      death. While holding your spellbook, you gain the following
      benefits.</p><p><em><strong>Bolster Undead.</strong></em> As a Bonus
      Action, choose any number of Undead you have created or summoned with a
      Necromancy spell that are within 60 feet of you. Those Undead each gain
      Temporary Hit Points equal to your Wizard level. Once an Undead gains
      Temporary Hit Points from this feature, it can't gain them in this way
      again for the next 24 hours.</p><p><em><strong>Extinguish
      Undead.</strong></em> When an Undead creature you can see is reduced to 0
      Hit Points, you can cause it to explode with necrotic energy. Roll a
      number of d6s equal to half the creature's unexpended Hit Dice (round up,
      minimum of 1d6) and add them together. Each creature in a 10-foot
      Emanation originating from the Undead makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a
      failed save, a target takes Necrotic damage equal to the number rolled and
      can't take Reactions until the start of its next turn. On a successful
      save, a target takes half as much damage only. When you use this feature
      to explode an Undead creature you don't control, you must take a Reaction
      and expend a level 5+ spell slot to do so.</p>
