    value: >-
      <p>You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or dance.
      This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration die, which is a
      d6.</p><p><em><strong>Using Bardic Inspiration.</strong></em> As a Bonus
      Action, you can inspire another creature within 60 feet of yourself who
      can see or hear you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration
      dice. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a
      time.</p><p>Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test,
      the creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled
      to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. A Bardic
      Inspiration die is expended when itâ€™s rolled.</p><p><em><strong>Number of
      Uses.</strong></em> You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a number of
      times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain
      all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.</p><p>At Higher Levels.
      Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain Bard levels, as
      shown in the Bardic Die column of the Bard Features table. The die becomes
      a d8 at level 5, a d10 at level 10, and a d12 at level 15.</p><p></p>
