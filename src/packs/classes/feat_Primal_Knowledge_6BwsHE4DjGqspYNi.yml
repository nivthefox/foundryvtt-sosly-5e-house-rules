    value: >-
      <p>You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill
      list available to Barbarians at level 1.</p><p>In addition, while your
      Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain
      tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following
      skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a
      different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or
      Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power
      coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.</p><p></p>
