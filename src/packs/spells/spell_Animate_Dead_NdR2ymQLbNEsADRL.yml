    value: >-
      <p>Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a creature within range. The
      creature must be a humanoid, aberration, beast, dragon, giant, or
      monstrosity, and its Challenge Rating can be no higher than the level of
      the spell slot used to cast this spell, divided by 3 (round up). The
      target becomes an Undead creature, applying the
      @UUID[Compendium.sosly-5e-house-rules.spells.Item.0vA3UWKLURcdNPwU]{Skeletal
      Creature} or the
      @UUID[Compendium.sosly-5e-house-rules.spells.Item.LU66U3A1CyhlSjTi]{Zombified
      Creature} template.</p><p>On each of your turns, you can take a Bonus
      Action to mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the
      creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you
      can command any of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each
      one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move
      on its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a
      chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the
      Dodge action and moves only to avoid harm. Once given an order, the
      creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p><p>The
      creature is under your control until you complete a long rest, after which
      it stops obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the
      creature, you can choose not to regain this spell slot during your long
      rest. This restriction reasserts your control over up to four creatures
      you have animated with this spell rather than animating a new
      creature.</p><p><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong> You
      animate or reassert control over two additional Undead creatures for each
      spell slot level above 3. Each of the creatures must come from a different
      corpse or pile of bones.</p>
