    value: >-
      <p>While you remain shape-changed into a Beast form, your movement is
      increased by 20 feet, and you ignore difficult terrain. Creatures hit by
      your melee attacks while shape-shifted into a beast form take an extra 2d6
      damage, and their speed is reduced by a cumulative 5 feet until the end of
      your next turn. The extra damage is the same as the attack's damage
      type.</p> <p><em><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong></em>
      Your movement increases by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 4.</p>
