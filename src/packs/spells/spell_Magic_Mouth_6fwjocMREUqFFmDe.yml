      <p>You implant a message within an object in range, a message that is
      uttered when a trigger condition is met. Choose an object that you can see
      and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Then speak the
      message, which must be 25 words or less, though it can be delivered over
      as long as 10 minutes. Finally, determine the circumstance that will
      trigger the spell to deliver your message.</p>

      <p>When that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object
      and recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you spoke. If
      the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks like a mouth (for
      example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth appears there so that
      the words appear to come from the object's mouth. When you cast this
      spell, you can have the spell end after it delivers its message, or it can
      remain and repeat its message whenever the trigger occurs.</p>

      <p>The triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you
      like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur
      within 30 feet of the object. For example, you could instruct the mouth to
      speak when any creature moves within 30 feet of the object or when a
      silver bell rings within 30 feet of it.</p>
