    value: >-
      <p>Threads of dark power leap from your fingers to pierce up to five Small
      or Medium corpses you can see within range. Each corpse immediately stands
      up and becomes undead. You decide whether it is a zombie or a skeleton
      (the statistics for zombies and skeletons are in the Monster Manual), and
      it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your spellcasting
      ability modifier.</p><p>You can use a bonus action to mentally command the
      creatures you make with this spell, issuing the same command to all of
      them. To receive the command, a creature must be within 60 feet of you.
      You decide what action the creatures will take and where they will move
      during their next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to
      guard a chamber or passageway against your foes. If you issue no commands,
      the creatures do nothing except defend themselves against hostile
      creatures. Once given an order, the creatures continue to follow it until
      their task is complete.</p><p>The creatures are under your control until
      the spell ends, after which they become inanimate once
      more.</p><p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell
      using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you animate up to two
      additional corpses for each slot level above 5th.</p><p></p>
