      <p>You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow
      larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object
      that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make
      a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.</p>

      <p>If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying
      changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to
      normal size at once.</p>

      <p><strong>Enlarge.</strong> The target's size doubles in all dimensions,
      and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by
      one category-- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough
      room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the
      maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the
      target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
      The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons
      are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.</p>

      <p><strong>Reduce.</strong> The target's size is halved in all dimensions,
      and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction
      decreases its size by one category--from Medium to Small, for example.
      Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks
      and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its
      new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them
      deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).</p>
