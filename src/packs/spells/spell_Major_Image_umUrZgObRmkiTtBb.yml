    value: >-
      <p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible
      phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a
      spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems
      completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to
      the thing depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause
      damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature,
      or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's
      stench).</p><p>As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can
      use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range.
      As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its
      movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an
      image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it
      appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make
      different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a
      conversation, for example.</p><p>Physical interaction with the image
      reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A
      creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it
      is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check
      against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what
      it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory
      qualities become faint to the creature.</p><p><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level
      or higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your
      concentration.</p>
