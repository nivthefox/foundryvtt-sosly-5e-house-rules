    value: >-
      <p>You step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully contain
      your body, melding yourself and all the Equipment you carry with the stone
      for the Duration. Using your Movement, you step into the stone at a point
      you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains visible or otherwise
      detectable by nonmagical Senses.</p><p>While merged with the stone, you
      can't see what occurs outside it, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks you
      make to hear sounds outside it are made with disadvantage. You remain
      aware of the passage of time and can cast Spells on yourself while merged
      in the stone. You can use your Movement to leave the stone where you
      entered it, which ends the spell. You otherwise can't move.</p><p>Minor
      physical damage to the stone doesn't harm you, but its partial destruction
      or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no longer fit within it)
      expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to you. The stone's complete
      destruction (or Transmutation into a different substance) expels you and
      deals 50 bludgeoning damage to you. If expelled, you fall prone in an
      unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.</p>
