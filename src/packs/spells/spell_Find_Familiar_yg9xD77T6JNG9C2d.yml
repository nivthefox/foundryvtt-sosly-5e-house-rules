      <p>You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form
      you choose: bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl,
      poisonous snake, fish (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel.
      Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the
      statistics of the chosen form, though it is a celestial, fey, or fiend
      (your choice) instead of a beast.</p>

      <p>Your familiar acts independently of you, but it always obeys your
      commands. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn.
      A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal.</p>

      <p>When the familiar drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind
      no physical form. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As an
      action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension.
      Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an action while it is
      temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any unoccupied
      space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 hit points
      or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space
      anything it was wearing or carrying.</p>

      <p>While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with
      it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your
      familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn,
      gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During
      this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>

      <p>You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell
      while you already have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new
      form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your familiar
      transforms into the chosen creature.</p>

      <p>Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can
      deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell. Your familiar must be
      within 100 feet of you, and it must use its reaction to deliver the spell
      when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack roll, you use your
      attack modifier for the roll.</p>
