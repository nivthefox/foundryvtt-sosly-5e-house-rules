    value: >-
      <p>Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing
      creatures that you can see within range. You transform each target into
      the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or
      lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to transform affected
      creatures into new forms.</p>

      <p>The transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until the
      target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different form for
      each target. A target's game statistics are replaced by the statistics of
      the chosen beast, though the target retains its alignment and
      Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target assumes the hit
      points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns
      to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as
      a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
      its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the
      creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked
      @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious}. The creature is
      limited in the actions it can perform by the
      @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of its new form, and it
      can't speak or cast spells.</p>

      <p>The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate,
      wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>
