      <p>You assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of the
      following options, the effects of which last for the duration of the
      spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an action to gain
      the benefits of a different one.</p>

      <p><strong>Aquatic Adaptation.</strong> You adapt your body to an aquatic
      environment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your fingers. You
      can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking
      speed.</p>

      <p><strong>Change Appearance.</strong> You transform your appearance. You
      decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features,
      sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing
      characteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of
      another race, though none of your statistics change. You also can't appear
      as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the
      same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal,
      for instance. At any time for the duration of the spell, you can use your
      action to change your appearance in this way again.</p>

      <p><strong>Natural Weapons.</strong> You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns,
      or a different natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal
      1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the
      natural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed
      strikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1 bonus to
      the attack and damage rolls you make using it.</p>
