    value: >-
      <p>You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long- dead sage, or
      some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this
      extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast
      this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take
      6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While
      insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say,
      can't read, and speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration spell cast
      on you ends this effect.</p>

      <p>On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You
      must ask your questions before the spell ends. The GM answers each
      question with one word, such as "yes," "no," "maybe," "never,"
      "irrelevant," or "unclear" (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the
      question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the GM might instead
      offer a short phrase as an answer.</p>
