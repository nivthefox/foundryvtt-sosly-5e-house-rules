    value: >-
      <p>You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that
      you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving
      throw. On a failed save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or
      other visible phenomenon of your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot
      cube and that is perceivable only to the target for the duration. This
      spell has no effect on undead or constructs.</p>

      <p>The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also
      evident only to the creature.</p>

      <p>The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an
      Intelligence (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Investigation})
      check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds, the target
      realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends.</p>

      <p>While a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm
      as if it were real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from
      interacting with the phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk
      across a phantasmal bridge that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the
      bridge. If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge
      exists and comes up with some other explanation for its fall - it was
      pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.</p>

      <p>An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm’s reality that it
      can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to appear as a
      creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as
      fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your
      turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in
      the phantasm’s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the
      illusion is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such
      as by attacking. The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to
      the illusion.</p>
