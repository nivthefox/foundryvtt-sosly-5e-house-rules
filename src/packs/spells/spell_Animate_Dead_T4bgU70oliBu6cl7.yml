    value: >-
      <p>This spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a
      corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the
      target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead creature. The
      target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a zombie if you chose a
      corpse (the GM has the creature's game statistics).</p>

      <p>On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command
      any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of
      you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them
      at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what
      action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn,
      or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber
      or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself
      against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to
      follow it until its task is complete.</p>

      <p>The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops
      obeying any command you've given it. To maintain control of the creature
      for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again
      before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts
      your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell,
      rather than animating a new one.</p>

      <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a
      spell slot of 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over
      two additional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of the
      creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.</p>
