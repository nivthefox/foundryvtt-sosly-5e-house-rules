      <p>The target hit by the attack takes an extra 1d6 damage, and the target
      is grappled by you. To escape the grapple, they must use their action to
      make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your
      spell save DC. While you maintain the grapple, you have advantage on your
      attack rolls for any melee attacks made while shape-shifted into a Beast
      form.</p> <p><em><strong>Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.</strong></em>
      The extra damage increases by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 1.</p>
