    value: >-
      <p>You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your
      choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The
      corpse must still have a mouth and can't be undead. The spell fails if the
      corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10 days.</p><p>Until
      the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse
      knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers
      are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no
      compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it
      recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn't return the creature's soul
      to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can't learn new
      information, doesn't comprehend anything that has happened since it died,
      and can't speculate about future events.</p>
