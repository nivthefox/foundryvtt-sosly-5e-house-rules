    value: >-
      <p>You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot
      cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be
      affected by this spell for the duration.</p><p>An affected target's speed
      is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it
      can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus
      action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items,
      it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its
      turn.</p><p>If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time
      of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect
      until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on
      that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.</p><p>A
      creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the
      end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.</p>
