    value: >-
      <p>You choose an area of water that you can see within range and that fits
      within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>

      <p>You instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as
      you direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t have
      enough force to cause damage.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>You cause the water to form into simple shapes and animate at your
      direction. This change lasts for 1 hour.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>You change the water’s color or opacity. The water must be changed in
      the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1 hour.</p>

      </li>

      <li>

      <p>You freeze the water, provided that there are no creatures in it. The
      water unfreezes in 1 hour.</p>

      </li>

      </ul>

      <p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of
      its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such
      an effect as an action.</p>
