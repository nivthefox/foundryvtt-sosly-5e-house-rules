    value: >-
      <p>You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall Cylinder of magical energy
      centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing
      runes appear wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other
      surface.</p><p>Choose one or more of the following types of creatures:
      Celestials, Elementals, fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a
      creature of the chosen type in the following ways:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means.
      If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so,
      it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw.</li>

      <li>The creature has disadvantage on Attack rolls against Targets within
      the Cylinder.</li>

      <li>Targets within the cylinder can't be Charmed, Frightened, or possessed
      by the creature.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate
      in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from
      leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.</p><p><strong>At
      Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
      level or higher, the Duration increases by 1 Hour for each slot level
      above 3rd.</p>
