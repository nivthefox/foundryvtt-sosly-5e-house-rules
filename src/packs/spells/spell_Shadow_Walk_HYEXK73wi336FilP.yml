    value: >-
      <p>You and up to 5 creatures that you touch are transported along a
      coiling path of shadowstuff to the edge of the Material Plane where it
      borders the Shadowfell.  While on this quasi-real path, a creature's
      walking speed is ten times faster, they are not affected by difficult
      terrain, and they can walk over water as if it were a solid surface
      Creatures affected by this spell cannot make out details on the Material
      Plane, but can get a rough idea of exactly where they are from visual
      landmarks. </p><p>When this spell ends, every creature affected by the
      spell is immediately returned to the Material Plane wherever they have
      managed to travel to.</p><p>You cannot cast this spell in bright light,
      and it has no effect on a plane other than the Material Plane.  If a
      target of the spell is not willing to be transported, they can make a
      Charisma saving throw to avoid the effect.</p>
