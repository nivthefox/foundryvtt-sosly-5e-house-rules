      <p>For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures. When
      you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends,
      you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30
      feet of you. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower
      or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.</p>

      <p>You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most
      on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either shift your
      attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to probe deeper into
      the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a
      Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain
      @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{insight} into its reasoning (if
      any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind
      (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the
      spell ends. Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its
      mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts,
      the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check
      contested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell ends.</p>

      <p>Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the
      course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of
      an interrogation.</p>

      <p>You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking
      creatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action during
      the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you. The spell
      can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other
      than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you. You can’t detect a creature
      with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn’t speak any
      language.</p>

      <p>Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read
      its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you
      can’t see it, but it must still be within range.</p>
