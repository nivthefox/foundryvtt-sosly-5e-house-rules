    value: >-
      <p>You send a missile of magical force, camouflaged and disguised by
      illusion, hurtling at one creature that you can see within range. The
      target must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking [[/damage 5d4
      type=force]] damage on a failure, or half as much damage on a success.</p>
      <p>A target automatically succeeds on its save against the spell if it
      doesn't rely on sight, as with blindsight, or if it can see through
      illusions, as with truesight.</p> <p><em><strong>At Higher
      Levels.</strong></em> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd
      level or higher, the damage increases by [[/damage 2d4]] for each slot
      level above 1st.</p>
