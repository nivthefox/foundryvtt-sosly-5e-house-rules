    value: >-
      <p>You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each
      creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop
      whatever it is holding and become Frightened for the duration.</p><p>While
      Frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move
      away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless
      there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location
      where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom
      saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.</p>
