      <p>As a bonus action on your turn, you mark one target you can see that is
      within 30 feet of you. While a target is marked by you, it has
      disadvantage on attack rolls for any attack that doesn't include you as a
      target. A creature can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark
      supersedes a mark that was already in place.</p><p>When a creature you
      have marked makes an attack that doesn't include you as a target, you can
      expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target. This damage is
      2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than
      1st, to a maximum of 6d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an
      undead or a fiend, to a maximum of 6d8.</p><p>The mark expires if you use
      this ability to mark a different creature. The mark also ends if you make
      an attack against a creature other than the target of the mark, unless you
      have also attacked your target during this turn, or are adjacent to the
      target.</p>
