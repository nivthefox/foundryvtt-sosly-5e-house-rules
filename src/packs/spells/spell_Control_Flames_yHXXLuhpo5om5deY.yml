    value: >-
      <p>You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits
      within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided
      that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.</li>

      <li>You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.</li>

      <li>You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the
      flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.</li>

      <li>You cause simple shapes—such as the vague form of a creature, an
      inanimate object, or a location—to appear within the flames and animate as
      you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.</li>

      </ul>

      <p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its
      non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an
      effect as an action.</p>
