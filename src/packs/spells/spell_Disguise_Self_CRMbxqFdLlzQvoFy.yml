    value: >-
      <p>You make yourself--including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other
      belongings on your person--look different until the spell ends or until
      you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller
      and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type,
      so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.
      Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.</p>

      <p>The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical
      inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your
      outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel
      nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear
      thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you
      would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.</p>

      <p>To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to
      inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence
      (@Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{Investigation}) check against
      your spell save DC.</p>
