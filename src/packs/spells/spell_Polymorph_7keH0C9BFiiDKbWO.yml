    value: >-
      <p>This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a
      new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid
      the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0
      hit points.</p>

      <p>The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to
      0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating
      is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it
      doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including
      mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast.
      It retains its alignment and personality.</p>

      <p>The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to
      its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had
      before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit
      points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the
      excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points,
      it isn't knocked
      @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{unconscious}.</p>

      <p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the
      @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.0AGfrwZRzSG0vNKb]{nature} of its new form, and it
      can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or
      speech.</p>

      <p>The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate,
      use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>
