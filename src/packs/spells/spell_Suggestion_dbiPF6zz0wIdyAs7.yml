    value: >-
      <p>You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and
      magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and
      understand you. Creatures that can't be
      @Compendium[dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{charmed} are immune to this
      effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the
      course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself,
      throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously
      harmful act ends the spell.</p>

      <p>The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it
      pursues the course of action you described to the best of its ability. The
      suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. If the
      suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the spell ends when
      the subject finishes what it was asked to do.</p>

      <p>You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity
      during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight give her
      warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition isn't met before
      the spell expires, the activity isn't performed.</p>

      <p>If you or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.</p>
