    value: >-
      <p>Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns for the duration of the
      spell. On a roll of 11 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of
      existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane (the spell fails and the
      casting is wasted if you were already on that plane). At the start of your
      next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you
      return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10
      feet of the space you vanished from. If no unoccupied space is available
      within that range, you appear in the nearest unoccupied space (chosen at
      random if more than one space is equally near). You can dismiss this spell
      as an action.</p><p>While on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the
      plane you originated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can't
      see anything there more than 60 feet away. You can only affect and be
      affected by other creatures on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures that aren't
      there can't perceive you or interact with you, unless they have the
      ability to do so.</p>
