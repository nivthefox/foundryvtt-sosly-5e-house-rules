      <p>When you cast this spell, all footprints and fingerprints within a
      30-foot emanation originating from you become highlighted and glow faintly
      for the duration. When you cast the spell, choose any point in time up to
      10 days ago. Only footprints and fingerprints left between that time and
      the present will be highlighted. Each creature that leaves footprints and
      fingerprints is assigned a unique color, but are not otherwise identified.
      Any creature that moves or touches objects within the Emanation will also
      leave colorful footprints and fingerprints, which might reveal
      <strong>invisible</strong> creatures in the area.</p>
