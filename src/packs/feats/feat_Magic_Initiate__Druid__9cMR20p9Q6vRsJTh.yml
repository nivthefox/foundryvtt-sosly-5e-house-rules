      <p>You gain the following benefits.</p><p><em><strong>Two
      Cantrips.</strong></em> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the
      Druid spell list. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting
      ability for this feat’s spells (choose when you select this
      feat).</p><p><em><strong>Level 1 Spell.</strong></em> Choose a level 1
      spell from the same list you selected for this feat’s cantrips. You always
      have that spell prepared. You can cast it once without a spell slot, and
      you regain the ability to cast it in that way when you finish a Long Rest.
      You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you
      have.</p><p><em><strong>Spell Change.</strong></em> Whenever you gain a
      new level, you can replace one of the spells you chose for this feat with
      a different spell of the same level from the chosen spell
      list.</p><p><em><strong>Repeatable.</strong></em> You can take this feat
      more than once, but you must choose a different spell list each
      time.</p><p></p>
