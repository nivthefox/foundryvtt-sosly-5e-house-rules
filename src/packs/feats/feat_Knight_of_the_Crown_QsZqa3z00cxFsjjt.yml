      <p>You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Crown, a
      group that extols the virtues of cooperation, loyalty, and obedience. You
      excel in group combat and gain these benefits:</p><p><strong>Ability Score
      Increase.</strong> Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution
      score by 1, to a maximum of 20.</p><p><strong>Commanding Rally.</strong>
      As a bonus action, you can command one ally within 30 feet of yourself to
      attack. If that ally can see or hear you, they can immediately make one
      weapon attack as a reaction. If the attack hits, the ally can roll a d8
      and add the number rolled as a bonus to the attackâ€™s damage roll. You can
      use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus,
      and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p><p></p>
