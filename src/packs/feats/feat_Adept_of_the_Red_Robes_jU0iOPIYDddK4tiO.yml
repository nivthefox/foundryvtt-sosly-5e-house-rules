      <p>You chose the moon Lunitari to influence your magic, and your
      dedication to maintaining the balance between all things has been
      recognized by the Order of the Red Robes, granting you these
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Insightful Magic.</strong> You learn one 2nd-level
      spell of your choice. The 2nd-level spell must be from the illusion or
      transmutation school of magic. You can cast this feat’s 2nd-level spell
      without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast
      it in this way again. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you
      have of the appropriate level. The spell’s spellcasting ability is the one
      chosen when you gained the Initiate of High Sorcery
      feat.</p><p><strong>Magical Balance.</strong> When you make an attack roll
      or an ability check and roll a 9 or lower on the d20, you can balance fate
      and treat the roll as a 10. You can balance fate in this way a number of
      times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses
      when you finish a long rest.</p><p></p>
