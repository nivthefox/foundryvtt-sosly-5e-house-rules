  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You chose the moon Nuitari to influence your magic, and your ambition
      and loyalty to the Order of the Black Robes have been recognized, granting
      you these benefits:</p><p><strong>Ambitious Magic.</strong> You learn one
      2nd-level spell of your choice. The 2nd-level spell must be from the
      enchantment or necromancy school of magic. You can cast this feat’s
      2nd-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest
      before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast this spell
      using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spell’s
      spellcasting ability is the one chosen when you gained the Initiate of
      High Sorcery feat.</p><p><strong>Life Channel.</strong> You can channel
      your life force into the power of your magic. When a creature you can see
      within 60 feet of you fails a saving throw against a spell that deals
      damage that you cast, you can expend a number of Hit Dice equal to the
      level of the spell. Roll the expended Hit Dice and add them together. The
      damage that the creature takes increases by an amount equal to that
      total.</p><p></p>
