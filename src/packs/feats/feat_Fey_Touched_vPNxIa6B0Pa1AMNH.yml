      <p>You learn the
      @UUID[Compendium.dnd-players-handbook.spells.phbsplMistyStep0]{Misty Step}
      spell, and one 1st Level spell of your choice. The 1st Level spell must be
      from the divination or enchantment school of magic.  You can cast each of
      these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these
      spells in this way, you canâ€™t cast that spell in this way again until you
      finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you
      have of the appropriate level. </p><p>Your spellcasting ability for these
      spells is your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, chosen when you gain
      this feat.</p>
