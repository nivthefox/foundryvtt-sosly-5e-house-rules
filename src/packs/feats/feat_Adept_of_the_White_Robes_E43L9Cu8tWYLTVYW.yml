  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You chose the moon Solinari to influence your magic, and your oath to
      use magic to make the world a better place has been recognized by the
      Order of the White Robes, granting you these
      benefits:</p><p><strong>Protective Magic.</strong> You learn one 2nd-level
      spell of your choice. The 2nd-level spell must be from the abjuration or
      divination school of magic. You can cast this feat’s 2nd-level spell
      without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast
      it in this way again. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you
      have of the appropriate level. The spell’s spellcasting ability is the one
      chosen when you gained the Initiate of High Sorcery
      feat.</p><p><strong>Protective Ward.</strong> When you or a creature you
      can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to
      expend a spell slot and weave protective magic around the target. Roll a
      number of d6s equal to the level of the spell slot expended and reduce the
      damage the target takes by the total rolled on those dice + your
      spellcasting ability modifier.</p><p></p>
