  description:
    value: >-
      <p>You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Sword, a
      group devoted to heroism and courage. Bravery steels your spirit, granting
      you these benefits:</p><p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong>
      Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum
      of 20.</p><p><strong>Demoralizing Strike.</strong> Once per turn, when you
      hit a creature with a weapon attack roll, you can attempt to frighten that
      target. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your
      proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this
      feat). On a failed save, the target is frightened of you until the end of
      your next turn. On a successful save, the target has disadvantage on the
      next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. You can use
      this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you
      regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
