      <p>Hengeyokai (pronounced hen-gey-OH-kai) are shapeshifting beings
      descended from nature spirits who gained physical form. Each hengeyokai
      can transform between a humanoid shape and that of a small animal like a
      fox, cat, or badger. Their spiritual heritage manifests even in their
      humanoid form through animal traits that vary in prominence—some display
      subtle features like unusual eyes or pointed ears, while others show more
      obvious signs like fur patches or tails.</p><p>Hengeyokai are born as
      animals and gain their shapeshifting ability in early childhood. They have
      deep connections to spirit-touched places where the material and spiritual
      worlds overlap, creating communities where mortals and spirits coexist.
      Though they can live for several centuries, many hengeyokai eventually
      lose their ability to change shape in old age, remaining in their last
      chosen form. Their animal aspects always match creatures native to their
      birthplace, and both their human and animal forms age in parallel, showing
      the same signs of youth or wisdom.</p><h3>Hengeyokai
      Traits</h3><p><strong>Creature Type:</strong> Humanoid
      (Shapechanger)</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium (about 4–7 feet tall)
      or Small (about 2–4 feet tall), chosen when you select this
      species</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> 30 feet</p><p></p><p>As a
      Hengeyokai, you have the following features:</p><p><strong>Animal Spirit
      Form.</strong> As an action, you can change into a beast form or your
      humanoid form. When you do so, your equipment melds into your new form,
      and you gain certain benefits depending on the type of animal you
      transform into. While in your beast form, your statistics remain the same
      but you are unable to make attacks or cast spells. You can talk in your
      animal form. Pick the type of animal you can transform into, which must be
      Tiny or Small, and then pick one of the following options that makes sense
      for your animal form. These traits only apply to your animal or hybrid
      form.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Burrower.</strong> As an action, you can
      burrow 10 feet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Aquatic.</strong> You gain a swim
      speed of 30 feet and can breathe air and water. Your walking speed becomes
      10 feet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Climber.</strong> You gain a climb speed
      equal to your speed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flier.</strong> You gain a fly
      speed of 30 feet. Your walking speed becomes 10
      feet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sprinter.</strong> Your walking speed
      increased by +10 feet.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Natural Weapons.
      </strong>In your hybrid form, you have claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing),
      horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your Unarmed
      Strike to deal damage with that feature, it deals 1d4 damage of the type
      in paranthesis instead of dealing the normal damage for your Unarmed
      Strike. You are proficient in your natural weaponry.</p><p></p><p>As a
      Hengeyokai, you have two of the following minor features (chosen at level
      1):</p><ul><li><p><strong>Beast Whisperer.</strong> You can speak to and
      be understood by the animals of the same type that you can transform into.
      For example, if you can transform into a badger, you can speak to other
      badgers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim
      light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as
      if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of
      gray.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deceptive.</strong> You have proficiency in
      the Deception skill.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fleet Foot.</strong> Your base
      walking speed is 35 feet.</p></li><li><p><strong>Free Spirit.</strong> You
      are hard to pin down. You have advantage on any checks or saving throws to
      avoid or escape from grapples or restraints.</p></li></ul>
