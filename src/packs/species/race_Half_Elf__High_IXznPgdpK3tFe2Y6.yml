      <p>Created by the god Corellon, the first elves could change their forms
      at will. They lost this ability when Corellon cursed them for plotting
      with the deity Lolth, who tried and failed to usurp Corellon’s dominion.
      When Lolth was cast into the Abyss, most elves renounced her and earned
      Corellon’s forgiveness, but that which Corellon had taken from them was
      lost forever.</p><p>No longer able to shape-shift at will, the elves
      retreated to the Feywild, where their sorrow was deepened by that plane’s
      influence. Over time, curiosity led many of them to explore other planes
      of existence, including worlds in the Material Plane.</p><p>Elves have
      pointed ears and lack facial and body hair. They live for around 750
      years, and they don’t sleep but instead enter a trance when they need to
      rest. In that state, they remain aware of their surroundings while
      immersing themselves in memories and meditations.</p><p>An environment
      subtly transforms elves after they inhabit it for a millennium or more,
      and it grants them certain kinds of magic. Drow, high elves, and wood
      elves are examples of elves who have been transformed thus.</p><h3
      data-anchor="high-elves">High Elves</h3><p>High elves have been infused
      with the magic of crossings between the Feywild and the Material Plane. On
      some worlds, high elves refer to themselves by other names. For example,
      they call themselves sun or moon elves in the Forgotten Realms setting,
      Silvanesti and Qualinesti in the Dragonlance setting, and Aereni in the
      Eberron setting.</p><h3 data-anchor="elf-traits">Elf

      finish a Long Rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you
      have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your
      spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the
