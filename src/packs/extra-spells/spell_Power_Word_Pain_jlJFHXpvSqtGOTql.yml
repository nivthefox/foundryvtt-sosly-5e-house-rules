      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You speak a word of power that causes
      waves of intense pain to assail one creature you can see within range. If
      the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to crippling pain.
      Otherwise, the spell has no effect on it. A target is also unaffected if
      it is immune to being &amp;Reference[condition=charmed].</p><p>While the
      target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher
      than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability
      checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally,
      if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a
      Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is
      wasted.</p><p>A target suffering this pain can make a Constitution saving
      throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the pain
      ends.</p></div>
