    value: >-
      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied
      space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from
      compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within
      5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed
      save, the target takes [[/damage 2d6 type=bludgeoning]] damage and is
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] for the spell's duration.</p><p>As an
      action, you can cause the hand to crush the
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] target, which must make a Strength
      saving throw. The target takes [[/damage 2d6 type=bludgeoning]] damage on
      a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><p>To break
      out, the &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] target can use its action to
      make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target
      escapes and is no longer &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] by the
      hand.</p><p>As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different
      creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand
      releases a &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] target if you do
      either.</p></div>
