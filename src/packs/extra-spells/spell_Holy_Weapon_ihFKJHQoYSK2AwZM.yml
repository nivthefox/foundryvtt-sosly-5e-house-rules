      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You imbue a weapon you touch with holy
      power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot
      radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon
      attacks made with it deal an extra [[/damage 2d8 type=radiant]] damage on
      a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the
      duration.</p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell
      and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your
      choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a
      Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/damage
      4d8 type=radiant]] damage, and it is &amp;Reference[condition=blinded] for
      1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and
      isn't &amp;Reference[condition=blinded]. At the end of each of its turns,
      a &amp;Reference[condition=blinded] creature can make a Constitution
      saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p></div>
