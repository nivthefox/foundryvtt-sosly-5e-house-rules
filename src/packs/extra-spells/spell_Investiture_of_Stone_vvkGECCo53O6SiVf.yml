      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>Until the spell ends, bits of rock spread
      across your body, and you gain the following benefits:</p><ul
      class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">You have resistance to bludgeoning,
      piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.</li><li
      class="rd__li ">You can use your action to create a small earthquake on
      the ground in a 15-foot radius centered on you. Other creatures on that
      ground must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked
      &amp;Reference[condition=prone].</li><li class="rd__li ">You can move
      across &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain} made of
      earth or stone without spending extra movement. You can move through solid
      earth or stone as if it was air and without destabilizing it, but you
      can't end your movement there. If you do so, you are ejected to the
      nearest unoccupied space, this spell ends, and you are
      &amp;Reference[condition=stunned] until the end of your next
      turn.</li></ul></div>
