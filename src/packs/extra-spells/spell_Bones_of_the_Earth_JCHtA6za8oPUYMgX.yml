      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You cause up to six pillars of stone to
      burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar
      is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet.
      The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter,
      and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium
      or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit
      points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of
      &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain} with a 10-foot
      radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter
      portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p><p>If
      a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a
      Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose
      to fail the save.</p><p>If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full
      height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar
      takes [[/damage 6d6 type=bludgeoning]] damage and is
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained], pinched between the pillar and the
      obstacle. The &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] creature can use an
      action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice)
      against the spell's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] and must either move off the pillar
      or fall off it.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p></p><div

      class="entry-title-inner">At Higher Levels.</span></span> When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two
      additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.</p></div></div>
