      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>This spell snatches the soul of a humanoid
      as it dies and traps it inside the tiny cage you use for the material
      component. A stolen soul remains inside the cage until the spell ends or
      until you destroy the cage, which ends the spell. While you have a soul
      inside the cage, you can exploit it in any of the ways described below.
      You can use a trapped soul up to six times. Once you exploit a soul for
      the sixth time, it is released, and the spell ends. While a soul is
      trapped, the dead humanoid it came from can't be revived.</p><div
      data-roll-name-ancestor="Steal Life" class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p><span
      class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">Steal Life.</span></span> You can use a bonus
      action to drain vigor from the soul and regain [[/r 2d8]] hit
      points.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor="Query Soul" class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="2"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">Query Soul.</span></span> You ask the soul a
      question (no action required) and receive a brief telepathic answer, which
      you can understand regardless of the language used. The soul knows only
      what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of
      its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be
      cryptic.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor="Borrow Experience"
      class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3"
      data-title-index="3"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Borrow
      Experience.</span></span> You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself
      with the soul's life experience, making your next attack roll, ability
      check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don't use this benefit
      before the start of your next turn, it is lost.</p></div><div
      data-roll-name-ancestor="Eyes of the Dead" class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="4"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">Eyes of the Dead.</span></span> You can use an
      action to name a place the humanoid saw in life, which creates an
      invisible sensor somewhere in that place if it is on the plane of
      existence you're currently on. The sensor remains for as long as you
      concentrate, up to 10 minutes (as if you were
      @status[concentration||concentrating] on a spell). You receive visual and
      auditory information from the sensor as if you were in its space using
      your senses.</p></div><p>A creature that can see the sensor (such as one
      using @spell[see invisibility] or &amp;Reference[rule=truesight]) sees a
      translucent image of the tormented humanoid whose soul you
      caged.</p></div>
