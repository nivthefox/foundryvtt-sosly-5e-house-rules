      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>Flames wreathe one creature you can see
      within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes
      [[/damage 8d6 type=fire]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
      on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the
      spell's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot
      radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its
      turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes [[/damage 4d6
      type=fire]] damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful
      one. These magical flames can't be extinguished by nonmagical
      means.</p><p>If damage from this spell kills a target, the target is
      turned to ash.</p></div>
