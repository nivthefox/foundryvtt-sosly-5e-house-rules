      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>A whirlwind howls down to a point that you
      can see on the ground within range. The whirlwind is a 10-foot-radius,
      30-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Until the spell ends, you
      can use your action to move the whirlwind up to 30 feet in any direction
      along the ground. The whirlwind sucks up any Medium or smaller objects
      that aren't secured to anything and that aren't worn or carried by
      anyone.</p><p>A creature must make a Dexterity saving throw the first time
      on a turn that it enters the whirlwind or that the whirlwind enters its
      space, including when the whirlwind first appears. A creature takes
      [[/damage 10d6 type=bludgeoning]] damage on a failed save, or half as much
      damage on a successful one. In addition, a Large or smaller creature that
      fails the save must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] in the whirlwind until the spell
      ends. When a creature starts its turn &amp;Reference[condition=restrained]
      by the whirlwind, the creature is pulled 5 feet higher inside it, unless
      the creature is at the top. A &amp;Reference[condition=restrained]
      creature moves with the whirlwind and falls when the spell ends, unless
      the creature has some means to stay aloft.</p><p>A
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] creature can use an action to make a
      Strength or Dexterity check against your spell save DC. If successful, the
      creature is no longer &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] by the
      whirlwind and is hurled [[/r 3d6 * 10]]{3d6 Ã— 10} feet away from it in a
      random direction.</p></div>
