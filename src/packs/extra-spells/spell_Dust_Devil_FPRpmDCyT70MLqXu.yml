      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>Choose an unoccupied 5-foot cube of air
      that you can see within range. An elemental force that resembles a dust
      devil appears in the cube and lasts for the spell's duration.</p><p>Any
      creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the dust devil must make a
      Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [[/damage 1d8
      type=bludgeoning]] damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the dust devil.
      On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't
      pushed.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet
      in any direction. If the dust devil moves over sand, dust, loose dirt, or
      light gravel, it sucks up the material and forms a 10-foot-radius cloud of
      debris around itself that lasts until the start of your next turn. The
      cloud heavily obscures its area.</p></div><div class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p></p><div data-roll-name-ancestor="At Higher Levels"

      data-title-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">At Higher
      Levels.</span></span> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd
      level or higher, the damage increases by [[/damage 1d8]] for each slot
      level above 2nd.</p></div></div>
