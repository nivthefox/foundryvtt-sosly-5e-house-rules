      one of the following effects at a point you can see within range:</p><ul
      class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">One Medium or smaller creature that
      you choose must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 5
      feet away from you.</li><li class="rd__li ">You create a small blast of
      air capable of moving one object that is neither held nor carried and that
      weighs no more than 5 pounds. The object is pushed up to 10 feet away from
      you. It isn't pushed with enough force to cause damage.</li><li
      class="rd__li ">You create a harmless sensory effect using air, such as
      causing leaves to rustle, wind to slam shutters closed, or your clothing
      to ripple in a breeze.</li></ul></div>
