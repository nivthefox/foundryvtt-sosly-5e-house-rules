      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You and up to eight willing creatures
      within range fall &amp;Reference[condition=unconscious] for the spell's
      duration and experience visions of another world on the Material Plane,
      such as Oerth, Toril, Krynn, or Eberron. If the spell reaches its full
      duration, the visions conclude with each of you encountering and pulling
      back a mysterious blue curtain. The spell then ends with you mentally and
      physically transported to the world that was in the visions.</p><p>To cast
      this spell, you must have a magic item that originated on the world you
      wish to reach, and you must be aware of the world's existence, even if you
      don't know the world's name. Your destination in the other world is a safe
      location within 1 mile of where the magic item was created. Alternatively,
      you can cast the spell if one of the affected creatures was born on the
      other world, which causes your destination to be a safe location within 1
      mile of where that creature was born.</p><p>The spell ends early on a
      creature if that creature takes any damage, and the creature isn't
      transported. If you take any damage, the spell ends for you and all the
      other creatures, with none of you being transported.</p></div>
