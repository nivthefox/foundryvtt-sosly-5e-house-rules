      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>A burst of cold energy emanates from you
      in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution
      saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes [[/damage 3d8 type=cold]]
      damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or
      another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice.
      A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a successful
      save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't hindered by
      ice.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p></p><div

      rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">At Higher Levels.</span></span> When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the cold
      damage by [[/damage 1d8]] for each slot level above 2nd.</p></div></div>
