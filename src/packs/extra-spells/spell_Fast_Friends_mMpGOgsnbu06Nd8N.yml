      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>When you need to make sure something gets
      done, you can't rely on vague promises, sworn oaths, or binding contracts
      of employment. When you cast this spell, choose one humanoid within range
      that can see and hear you, and that can understand you. The creature must
      succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
      &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] by you for the duration. While the
      creature is &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] in this way, it undertakes
      to perform any services or activities you ask of it in a friendly manner,
      to the best of its ability.</p><p>You can set the creature new tasks when
      a previous task is completed, or if you decide to end its current task. If
      the service or activity might cause harm to the creature, or if it
      conflicts with the creature's normal activities and desires, the creature
      can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect. This save
      is made with advantage if you or your companions are fighting the
      creature. If the activity would result in certain death for the creature,
      the spell ends.</p><p>When the spell ends, the creature knows it was
      &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] by you.</p></div><div class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p></p><div data-roll-name-ancestor="At Higher Levels"
      class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3"
      data-title-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">At Higher
      Levels.</span></span> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th
      level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot
      level above 3rd.</p></div></div>
