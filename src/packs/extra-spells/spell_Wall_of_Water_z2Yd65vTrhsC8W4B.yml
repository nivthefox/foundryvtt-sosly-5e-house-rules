      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You create a wall of water on the ground
      at a point you can see within range. You can make the wall up to 30 feet
      long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to
      20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall vanishes
      when the spell ends. The wall's space is
      &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain}.</p><p>Any ranged
      weapon attack that enters the wall's space has disadvantage on the attack
      roll, and fire damage is halved if the fire effect passes through the wall
      to reach its target. Spells that deal cold damage that pass through the
      wall cause the area of the wall they pass through to freeze solid (at
      least a 5-foot-square section is frozen). Each 5-foot-square frozen
      section has AC 5 and 15 hit points. Reducing a frozen section to 0 hit
      points destroys it. When a section is destroyed, the wall's water doesn't
      fill it.</p></div>
