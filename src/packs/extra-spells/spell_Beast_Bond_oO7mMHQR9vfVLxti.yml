    value: >-
      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You establish a telepathic link with one
      beast you touch that is friendly to you or
      &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] by you. The spell fails if the beast's
      Intelligence score is 4 or higher. Until the spell ends, the link is
      active while you and the beast are within line of sight of each other.
      Through the link, the beast can understand your telepathic messages to it,
      and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to
      you. While the link is active, the beast gains advantage on attack rolls
      against any creature within 5 feet of you that you can see.</p></div>
