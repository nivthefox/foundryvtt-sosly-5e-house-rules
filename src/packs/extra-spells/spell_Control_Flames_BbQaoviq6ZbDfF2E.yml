      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You choose nonmagical flame that you can
      see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one
      of the following ways:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">You
      instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that
      wood or other fuel is present in the new location.</li><li class="rd__li
      ">You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.</li><li
      class="rd__li ">You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light
      cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1
      hour.</li><li class="rd__li ">You cause simple shapes—such as the vague
      form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location—to appear within
      the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1
      hour.</li></ul><p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up
      to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you
      can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p></div>
