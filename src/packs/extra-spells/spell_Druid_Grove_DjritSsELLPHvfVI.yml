      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You invoke the spirits of nature to
      protect an area outdoors or underground. The area can be as small as a
      30-foot cube or as large as a 90-foot cube. Buildings and other structures
      are excluded from the affected area. If you cast this spell in the same
      area every day for a year, the spell lasts until dispelled.</p><p>The
      spell creates the following effects within the area. When you cast this
      spell, you can specify creatures as friends who are immune to the effects.
      You can also specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker
      immune to these effects.</p><p>The entire warded area radiates magic. A
      @spell[dispel magic] cast on the area, if successful, removes only one of
      the following effects, not the entire area. That spell's caster chooses
      which effect to end. Only when all its effects are gone is this spell
      dispelled.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor="Solid Fog" class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">Solid Fog.</span></span> You can fill any number
      of 5-foot squares on the ground with thick fog, making them heavily
      obscured. The fog reaches 10 feet high. In addition, every foot of
      movement through the fog costs 2 extra feet. To a creature immune to this
      effect, the fog obscures nothing and looks like soft mist, with motes of
      green light floating in the air.</p></div><div
      data-roll-name-ancestor="Grasping Undergrowth" class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="2"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">Grasping Undergrowth.</span></span> You can fill
      any number of 5-foot squares on the ground that aren't filled with fog
      with grasping weeds and vines, as if they were affected by an
      @spell[entangle] spell. To a creature immune to this effect, the weeds and
      vines feel soft and reshape themselves to serve as temporary seats or
      beds.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor="Grove Guardians"
      class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3"
      data-title-index="3"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Grove
      Guardians.</span></span> You can animate up to four trees in the area,
      causing them to uproot themselves from the ground. These trees have the
      same statistics as an @creature[awakened tree], which appears in the
      Monster Manual, except they can't speak, and their bark is covered with
      druidic symbols. If any creature not immune to this effect enters the
      warded area, the grove guardians fight until they have driven off or slain
      the intruders. The grove guardians also obey your spoken commands (no
      action required by you) that you issue while in the area. If you don't
      give them commands and no intruders are present, the grove guardians do
      nothing. The grove guardians can't leave the warded area. When the spell
      ends, the magic animating them disappears, and the trees take root again
      if possible.</p></div><div data-roll-name-ancestor="Additional Spell
      Effect" class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3"
      data-title-index="4"> <span class="entry-title-inner">Additional Spell
      Effect.</span></span> You can place your choice of one of the following
      magical effects within the warded area:</p></div><ul class="rd__list"><li
      class="rd__li ">A constant @spell[gust of wind] in two locations of your
      choice</li><li class="rd__li ">@spell[Spike growth] in one location of
      your choice</li><li class="rd__li ">@spell[Wind wall] in two locations of
      your choice</li></ul><p>To a creature immune to this effect, the winds are
      a fragrant, gentle breeze, and the area of @spell[spike growth] is
      harmless.</p></div>
