      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You attempt to bind a creature within an
      illusory cell that only it perceives. One creature you can see within
      range must make an Intelligence saving throw. The target succeeds
      automatically if it is immune to being &amp;Reference[condition=charmed].
      On a successful save, the target takes [[/damage 5d10 type=psychic]]
      damage, and the spell ends. On a failed save, the target takes [[/damage
      5d10 type=psychic]] damage, and you make the area immediately around the
      target's space appear dangerous to it in some way. You might cause the
      target to perceive itself as being surrounded by fire, floating razors, or
      hideous maws filled with dripping teeth. Whatever form the illusion takes,
      the target can't see or hear anything beyond it and is
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] for the spell's duration. If the
      target is moved out of the illusion, makes a melee attack through it, or
      reaches any part of its body through it, the target takes [[/damage 10d10
      type=psychic]] damage, and the spell ends.</p></div>
