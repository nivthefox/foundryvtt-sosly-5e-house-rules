      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You touch one Tiny, nonmagical object that
      isn't attached to another object or a surface and isn't being carried by
      another creature. The target animates and sprouts little arms and legs,
      becoming a creature under your control until the spell ends or the
      creature drops to 0 hit points. See the @creature[tiny servant|xge|stat
      block] for its statistics.</p><p>As a bonus action, you can mentally
      command the creature if it is within 120 feet of you. (If you control
      multiple creatures with this spell, you can command any or all of them at
      the same time, issuing the same command to each one.) You decide what
      action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn,
      or you can issue a simple, general command, such as to fetch a key, stand
      watch, or stack some books. If you issue no commands, the servant does
      nothing other than defend itself against hostile creatures. Once given an
      order, the servant continues to follow that order until its task is
      complete.</p><p>When the creature drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its
      original form, and any remaining damage carries over to that
      form.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p></p><div
      data-roll-name-ancestor="At Higher Levels" class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">At Higher Levels.</span></span> When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate two
      additional objects for each slot level above 3rd.</p></div></div>
