      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You choose an area of water that you can
      see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in
      one of the following ways:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li class="rd__li ">You
      instantaneously move or otherwise change the flow of the water as you
      direct, up to 5 feet in any direction. This movement doesn't have enough
      force to cause damage.</li><li class="rd__li ">You cause the water to form
      into simple shapes and animate at your direction. This change lasts for 1
      hour.</li><li class="rd__li ">You change the water's color or opacity. The
      water must be changed in the same way throughout. This change lasts for 1
      hour.</li><li class="rd__li ">You freeze the water, provided that there
      are no creatures in it. The water unfreezes in 1 hour.</li></ul><p>If you
      cast this spell multiple times, you can have no more than two of its
      non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an
      effect as an action.</p></div>
