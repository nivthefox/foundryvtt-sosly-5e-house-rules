      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You send ribbons of negative energy at one
      creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must
      make a Constitution saving throw, taking [[/damage 5d12 type=necrotic]]
      damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A
      target killed by this damage rises up as a @creature[zombie] at the start
      of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is
      closest to it. Statistics for the @creature[zombie] are in the Monster
      Manual.</p><p>If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn't
      make a saving throw. Instead, roll [[/r 5d12]]. The target gains half the
      total as temporary hit points.</p></div>
