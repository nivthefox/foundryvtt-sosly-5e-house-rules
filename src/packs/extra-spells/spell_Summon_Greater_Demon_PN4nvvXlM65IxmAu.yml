      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You utter foul words, summoning one demon
      from the chaos of the Abyss. You choose the demon's type, which must be <a
      href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flstchallenge%20rating:min=&amp;0~max=&amp;5,flsttag:demon=1,flstmiscellaneous:swarm=2">one
      of challenge rating 5 or lower</a>, such as a @creature[shadow demon] or a
      @creature[barlgura]. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see
      within range, and the demon disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or
      when the spell ends.</p><p>Roll initiative for the demon, which has its
      own turns. When you summon it and on each of your turns thereafter, you
      can issue a verbal command to it (requiring no action on your part),
      telling it what it must do on its next turn. If you issue no command, it
      spends its turn attacking any creature within reach that has attacked
      it.</p><p>At the end of each of the demon's turns, it makes a Charisma
      saving throw. The demon has disadvantage on this saving throw if you say
      its true name. On a failed save, the demon continues to obey you. On a
      successful save, your control of the demon ends for the rest of the
      duration, and the demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the
      nearest non-demons to the best of its ability. If you stop
      @status[concentration||concentrating] on the spell before it reaches its
      full duration, an uncontrolled demon doesn't disappear for [[/r 1d6]]
      rounds if it still has hit points.</p><p>As part of casting the spell, you
      can form a circle on the ground with the blood used as a material
      component. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. While the
      spell lasts, the summoned demon can't cross the circle or harm it, and it
      can't target anyone within it. Using the material component in this manner
      consumes it when the spell ends.</p></div><div class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p></p><div data-roll-name-ancestor="At Higher Levels"
      class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3"
      data-title-index="1"> <span class="entry-title-inner">At Higher
      Levels.</span></span> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th
      level or higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level
      above 4th.</p></div></div>
