      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>The light of dawn shines down on a
      location you specify within range. Until the spell ends, a 30-foot-radius,
      40-foot-high cylinder of bright light glimmers there. This light is
      sunlight.</p><p>When the cylinder appears, each creature in it must make a
      Constitution saving throw, taking [[/damage 4d10 type=radiant]] damage on
      a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must
      also make this saving throw whenever it ends its turn in the
      cylinder.</p><p>If you're within 60 feet of the cylinder, you can move it
      up to 60 feet as a bonus action on your turn.</p></div>
