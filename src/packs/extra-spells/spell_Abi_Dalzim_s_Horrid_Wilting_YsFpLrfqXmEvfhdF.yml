      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You draw the moisture from every creature
      in a 30-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range. Each
      creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. Constructs
      and undead aren't affected, and plants and water elementals make this
      saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes [[/damage 12d8
      type=necrotic]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one.</p><p>Nonmagical plants in the area that aren't creatures,
      such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.</p></div>
