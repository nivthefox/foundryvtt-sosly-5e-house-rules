      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You take control of the air in a 100-foot
      cube that you can see within range. Choose one of the following effects
      when you cast the spell. The effect lasts for the spell's duration, unless
      you use your action on a later turn to switch to a different effect. You
      can also use your action to temporarily halt the effect or to restart one
      you've halted.</p><div data-roll-name-ancestor="Gusts" class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">Gusts.</span></span> A wind picks up within the
      cube, continually blowing in a horizontal direction you designate. You
      choose the intensity of the wind: calm, moderate, or strong. If the wind
      is moderate or strong, ranged weapon attacks that pass through it or that
      are made against targets within the cube have disadvantage on their attack
      rolls. If the wind is strong, any creature moving against the wind must
      spend 1 extra foot of movement for each foot moved.</p></div><div
      data-roll-name-ancestor="Downdraft" class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p><span
      class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="2"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">Downdraft.</span></span> You cause a sustained
      blast of strong wind to blow downward from the top of the cube. Ranged
      weapon attacks that pass through the cube or that are made against targets
      within it have disadvantage on their attack rolls. A creature must make a
      Strength saving throw if it flies into the cube for the first time on a
      turn or starts its turn there flying. On a failed save, the creature is
      knocked &amp;Reference[condition=prone].</p></div><div
      data-roll-name-ancestor="Updraft" class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p><span
      class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="3"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">Updraft.</span></span> You cause a sustained
      updraft within the cube, rising upward from the cube's bottom side.
      Creatures that end a fall within the cube take only half damage from the
      fall. When a creature in the cube makes a vertical jump, the creature can
      jump up to 10 feet higher than normal.</p></div></div>
