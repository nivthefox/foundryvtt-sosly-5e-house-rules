      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You teleport yourself to an unoccupied
      space you can see within range. Immediately after you disappear, a
      thunderous boom sounds, and each creature within 10 feet of the space you
      left must make a Constitution saving throw, taking [[/damage 3d10
      type=thunder]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one. The thunder can be heard from up to 300 feet
      away.</p><p>You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn't
      exceed what you can carry. You can also teleport one willing creature of
      your size or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The
      creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell, and there
      must be an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your destination space for
      the creature to appear in; otherwise, the creature is left
      behind.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p></p><div

      class="entry-title-inner">At Higher Levels.</span></span> When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases
      by [[/damage 1d10]] for each slot level above 3rd.</p></div></div>
