      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You summon a spirit that assumes the form
      of a loyal, majestic mount. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range,
      the spirit takes on a form you choose: a @creature[griffon], a
      @creature[pegasus], a @creature[peryton], a @creature[dire wolf], a
      @creature[rhinoceros], or a @creature[saber-toothed tiger]. The creature
      has the statistics provided in the Monster Manual for the chosen form,
      though it is a celestial, a fey, or a fiend (your choice) instead of its
      normal creature type. Additionally, if it has an Intelligence score of 5
      or lower, its Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to
      understand one language of your choice that you speak.</p><p>You control
      the mount in combat. While the mount is within 1 mile of you, you can
      communicate with it telepathically. While mounted on it, you can make any
      spell you cast that targets only you also target the mount.</p><p>The
      mount disappears temporarily when it drops to 0 hit points or when you
      dismiss it as an action. Casting this spell again re-summons the bonded
      mount, with all its hit points restored and any conditions
      removed.</p><p>You can't have more than one mount bonded by this spell or
      @spell[find steed] at the same time. As an action, you can release a mount
      from its bond, causing it to disappear permanently.</p><p>Whenever the
      mount disappears, it leaves behind any objects it was wearing or
      carrying.</p><div class="rd__b-special rd__b-inset"
