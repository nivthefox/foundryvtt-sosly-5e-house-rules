      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You choose an area of stone or mud that
      you can see that fits within a 40-foot cube and is within range, and
      choose one of the following effects.</p><div
      data-roll-name-ancestor="Transmute Rock to Mud" class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">Transmute Rock to Mud.</span></span> Nonmagical
      rock of any sort in the area becomes an equal volume of thick, flowing mud
      that remains for the spell's duration.</p></div><p>The ground in the
      spell's area becomes muddy enough that creatures can sink into it. Each
      foot that a creature moves through the mud costs 4 feet of movement, and
      any creature on the ground when you cast the spell must make a Strength
      saving throw. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves
      into the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. On a
      failed save, a creature sinks into the mud and is
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained], though it can use an action to end
      the &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] condition on itself by pulling
      itself free of the mud.</p><p>If you cast the spell on a ceiling, the mud
      falls. Any creature under the mud when it falls must make a Dexterity
      saving throw. A creature takes [[/damage 4d8 type=bludgeoning]] damage on
      a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p><div
      data-roll-name-ancestor="Transmute Mud to Rock" class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="2"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">Transmute Mud to Rock.</span></span> Nonmagical
      mud or quicksand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into
      soft stone for the spell's duration. Any creature in the mud when it
      transforms must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, a
      creature is shunted safely to the surface in an unoccupied space. On a
      failed save, a creature becomes &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] by
      the rock. A &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] creature, or another
      creature within reach, can use an action to try to break the rock by
      succeeding on a [[/save ability=str dc=20]] check or by dealing damage to
      it. The rock has AC 15 and 25 hit points, and it is immune to poison and
      psychic damage.</p></div></div>
