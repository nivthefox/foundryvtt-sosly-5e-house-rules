      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>Threads of dark power leap from your
      fingers to pierce up to five Small or Medium corpses you can see within
      range. Each corpse immediately stands up and becomes undead. You decide
      whether it is a @creature[zombie] or a @creature[skeleton] (the statistics
      for @creature[zombie||zombies] and @creature[skeleton||skeletons] are in
      the Monster Manual), and it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls
      equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.</p><p>You can use a bonus
      action to mentally command the creatures you make with this spell, issuing
      the same command to all of them. To receive the command, a creature must
      be within 60 feet of you. You decide what action the creatures will take
      and where they will move during their next turn, or you can issue a
      general command, such as to guard a chamber or passageway against your
      foes. If you issue no commands, the creatures do nothing except defend
      themselves against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creatures
      continue to follow it until their task is complete.</p><p>The creatures
      are under your control until the spell ends, after which they become
      inanimate once more.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p></p><div
      data-roll-name-ancestor="At Higher Levels" class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">At Higher Levels.</span></span> When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you animate up to
      two additional corpses for each slot level above 5th.</p></div></div>
