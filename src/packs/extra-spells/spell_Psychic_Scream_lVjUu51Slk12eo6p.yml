      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You unleash the power of your mind to
      blast the intellect of up to ten creatures of your choice that you can see
      within range. Creatures that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are
      unaffected.</p><p>Each target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a
      failed save, a target takes [[/damage 14d6 type=psychic]] damage and is
      &amp;Reference[condition=stunned]. On a successful save, a target takes
      half as much damage and isn't &amp;Reference[condition=stunned]. If a
      target is killed by this damage, its head explodes, assuming it has
      one.</p><p>A &amp;Reference[condition=stunned] target can make an
      Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful
      save, the stunning effect ends.</p></div>
