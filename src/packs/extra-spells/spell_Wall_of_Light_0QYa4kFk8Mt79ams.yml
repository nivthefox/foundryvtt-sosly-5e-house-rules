      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>A shimmering wall of bright light appears
      at a point you choose within range. The wall appears in any orientation
      you choose: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can be free
      floating, or it can rest on a solid surface. The wall can be up to 60 feet
      long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight, but
      creatures and objects can pass through it. It emits bright light out to
      120 feet and dim light for an additional 120 feet.</p><p>When the wall
      appears, each creature in its area must make a Constitution saving throw.
      On a failed save, a creature takes [[/damage 4d8 type=radiant]] damage,
      and it is &amp;Reference[condition=blinded] for 1 minute. On a successful
      save, it takes half as much damage and isn't
      &amp;Reference[condition=blinded]. A &amp;Reference[condition=blinded]
      creature can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its
      turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p><p>A creature that
      ends its turn in the wall's area takes [[/damage 4d8 type=radiant]]
      damage.</p><p>Until the spell ends, you can use an action to launch a beam
      of radiance from the wall at one creature you can see within 60 feet of
      it. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes [[/damage 4d8
      type=radiant]] damage. Whether you hit or miss, reduce the length of the
      wall by 10 feet. If the wall's length drops to 0 feet, the spell
      ends.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p></p><div
      data-roll-name-ancestor="At Higher Levels" class="rd__b 
      rd__b--3"><p><span class="rd__h rd__h--3" data-title-index="1"> <span
      class="entry-title-inner">At Higher Levels.</span></span> When you cast
      this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases
      by [[/damage 1d8]] for each slot level above 5th.</p></div></div>
