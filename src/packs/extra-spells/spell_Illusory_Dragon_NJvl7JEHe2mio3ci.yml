      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>By gathering threads of shadow material
      from the Shadowfell, you create a Huge shadowy dragon in an unoccupied
      space that you can see within range. The illusion lasts for the spell's
      duration and occupies its space, as if it were a creature.</p><p>When the
      illusion appears, any of your enemies that can see it must succeed on a
      Wisdom saving throw or become &amp;Reference[condition=frightened] of it
      for 1 minute. If a &amp;Reference[condition=frightened] creature ends its
      turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to the illusion, it
      can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a
      success.</p><p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion
      up to 60 feet. At any point during its movement, you can cause it to
      exhale a blast of energy in a 60-foot cone originating from its space.
      When you create the dragon, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire,
      lightning, necrotic, or poison. Each creature in the cone must make an
      Intelligence saving throw, taking [[/damage 7d6]] damage of the chosen
      damage type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
      one.</p><p>The illusion is tangible because of the shadow stuff used to
      create it, but attacks miss it automatically, it succeeds on all saving
      throws, and it is immune to all damage and conditions. A creature that
      uses an action to examine the dragon can determine that it is an illusion
      by succeeding on an Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Investigation])
      check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for
      what it is, the creature can see through it and has advantage on saving
      throws against its breath.</p></div>
