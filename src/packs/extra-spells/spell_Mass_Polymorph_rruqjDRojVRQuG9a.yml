      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You transform up to ten creatures of your
      choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target must succeed on
      a Wisdom saving throw to resist the transformation. An unwilling
      shapechanger automatically succeeds on the save.</p><p>Each target assumes
      a beast form of your choice, and you can choose the same form or different
      ones for each target. The new form can be <a
      href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:beast=1,flstmiscellaneous:swarm=2">any
      beast</a> you have seen whose challenge rating is equal to or less than
      the target's (or half the target's level, if the target doesn't have a
      challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability
      scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, but the target
      retains its hit points, alignment, and personality.</p><p>Each target
      gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the hit points of its new
      form. These temporary hit points can't be replaced by temporary hit points
      from another source. A target reverts to its normal form when it has no
      more temporary hit points or it dies. If the spell ends before then, the
      creature loses all its temporary hit points and reverts to its normal
      form.</p><p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the
      nature of its new form. It can't speak, cast spells, or do anything else
      that requires hands or speech.</p><p>The target's gear melds into the new
      form. The target can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any
      of its equipment.</p></div>
