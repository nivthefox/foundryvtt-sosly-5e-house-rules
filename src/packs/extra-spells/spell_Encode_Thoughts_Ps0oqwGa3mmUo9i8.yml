      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>Putting a finger to your head, you pull a
      memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a
      tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists
      for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand
      appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless,
      semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is
      otherwise stationary.</p><p>If you cast this spell while
      @status[concentration||concentrating] on a spell or an ability that allows
      you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as @spell[detect
      thoughts] or @spell[modify memory]), you can transform the thoughts or
      memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought
      strand.</p><p>Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you
      to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand
      contains. (Casting @spell[detect thoughts] on the strand has the same
      effect.)</p></div>
