      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You choose a portion of dirt or stone that
      you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You
      manipulate it in one of the following ways:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li
      class="rd__li ">If you target an area of loose earth, you can
      instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up
      to 5 feet away. This movement doesn't involve enough force to cause
      damage.</li><li class="rd__li ">You cause shapes, colors, or both to
      appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or
      shaping patterns. The changes last for 1 hour.</li><li class="rd__li ">If
      the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become
      &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain}. Alternatively,
      you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already
      &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain}. This change
      lasts for 1 hour.</li></ul><p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you
      can have no more than two of its non-instantaneous effects active at a
      time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p></div>
