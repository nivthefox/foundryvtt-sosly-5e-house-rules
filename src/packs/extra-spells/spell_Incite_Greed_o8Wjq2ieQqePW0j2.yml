      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>When you cast this spell, you present the
      gem used as the material component and choose any number of creatures
      within range that can see you. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving
      throw or be &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] by you until the spell ends,
      or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. While
      &amp;Reference[condition=charmed] in this way, a creature can do nothing
      but use its movement to approach you in a safe manner. While an affected
      creature is within 5 feet of you, it cannot move, but simply stares
      greedily at the gem you present.</p><p>At the end of each of its turns, an
      affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this
      effect ends for that target.</p></div>
