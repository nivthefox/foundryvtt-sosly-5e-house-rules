      and you gain the following benefits:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li
      class="rd__li ">You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire
      damage.</li><li class="rd__li ">You can move across
      &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain} created by ice or
      snow without spending extra movement.</li><li class="rd__li ">The ground
      in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is
      &amp;Reference[rule=difficultterrain]{difficult terrain} for creatures
      other than you. The radius moves with you.</li><li class="rd__li ">You can
      use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from
      your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the
      cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes [[/damage 4d6
      type=cold]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has its
      speed halved until the start of your next turn.</li></ul></div>
