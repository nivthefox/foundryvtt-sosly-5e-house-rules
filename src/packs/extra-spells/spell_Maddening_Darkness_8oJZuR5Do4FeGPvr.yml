      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>Magical darkness spreads from a point you
      choose within range to fill a 60-foot-radius sphere until the spell ends.
      The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with
      &amp;Reference[rule=darkvision] can't see through this darkness.
      Non-magical light, as well as light created by spells of 8th level or
      lower, can't illuminate the area.</p><p>Shrieks, gibbering, and mad
      laughter can be heard within the sphere. Whenever a creature starts its
      turn in the sphere, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking [[/damage
      8d8 type=psychic]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one.</p></div>
