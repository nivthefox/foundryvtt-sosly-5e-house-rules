      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>Uttering a dark incantation, you summon a
      devil from the Nine Hells. You choose the devil's type, which must be one
      of <a
      href="https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flstchallenge%20rating:min=&amp;0~max=&amp;6,flsttag:devil=1,flstmiscellaneous:swarm=2">challenge
      rating 6 or lower</a>, such as a @creature[barbed devil] or a
      @creature[bearded devil]. The devil appears in an unoccupied space that
      you can see within range. The devil disappears when it drops to 0 hit
      points or when the spell ends.</p><p>The devil is unfriendly toward you
      and your companions. Roll initiative for the devil, which has its own
      turns. It is under the Dungeon Master's control and acts according to its
      nature on each of its turns, which might result in its attacking you if it
      thinks it can prevail, or trying to tempt you to undertake an evil act in
      exchange for limited service. The DM has the creature's
      statistics.</p><p>On each of your turns, you can try to issue a verbal
      command to the devil (no action required by you). It obeys the command if
      the likely outcome is in accordance with its desires, especially if the
      result would draw you toward evil. Otherwise, you must make a Charisma
      (&amp;Reference[skill=Deception], &amp;Reference[skill=Intimidation], or
      &amp;Reference[skill=Persuasion]) check contested by its Wisdom
      (&amp;Reference[skill=Insight]) check. You make the check with advantage
      if you say the devil's true name. If your check fails, the devil becomes
      immune to your verbal commands for the duration of the spell, though it
      can still carry out your commands if it chooses. If your check succeeds,
      the devil carries out your command—such as "attack my enemies," "explore
      the room ahead," or "bear this message to the queen"—until it completes
      the activity, at which point it returns to you to report having done
      so.</p><p>If your @status[concentration] ends before the spell reaches its
      full duration, the devil doesn't disappear if it has become immune to your
      verbal commands. Instead, it acts in whatever manner it chooses for [[/r
      3d6]] minutes, and then it disappears.</p><p>If you possess an individual
      devil's talisman, you can summon that devil if it is of the appropriate
      challenge rating plus 1, and it obeys all your commands, with no Charisma
      checks required.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p></p><div

      this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating
      increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.</p></div></div>
