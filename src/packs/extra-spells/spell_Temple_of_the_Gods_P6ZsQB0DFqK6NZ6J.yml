      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You cause a temple to shimmer into
      existence on ground you can see within range. The temple must fit within
      an unoccupied cube of space, up to 120 feet on each side. The temple
      remains until the spell ends. It is dedicated to whatever god, pantheon,
      or philosophy is represented by the holy symbol used in the
      casting.</p><p>You make all decisions about the temple's appearance. The
      interior is enclosed by a floor, walls, and a roof, with one door granting
      access to the interior and as many windows as you wish. Only you and any
      creatures you designate when you cast the spell can open or close the
      door.</p><p>The temple's interior is an open space with an idol or altar
      at one end. You decide whether the temple is illuminated and whether that
      illumination is bright light or dim light. The smell of burning incense
      fills the air within, and the temperature is mild.</p><p>The temple
      opposes types of creatures you choose when you cast this spell. Choose one
      or more of the following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead.
      If a creature of the chosen type attempts to enter the temple, that
      creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it can't
      enter the temple for 24 hours. Even if the creature can enter the temple,
      the magic there hinders it; whenever it makes an attack roll, an ability
      check, or a saving throw inside the temple, it must roll a [[/r d4]] and
      subtract the number rolled from the [[/r d20]] roll.</p><p>In addition,
      the sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the temple,
      and creatures within can't be targeted by divination
      spells.</p><p>Finally, whenever any creature in the temple regains hit
      points from a spell of 1st level or higher, the creature regains
      additional hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 hit
      point).</p><p>The temple is made from opaque magical force that extends
      into the Ethereal Plane, thus blocking ethereal travel into the temple's
      interior. Nothing can physically pass through the temple's exterior. It
      can't be dispelled by @spell[dispel magic], and @spell[antimagic field]
      has no effect on it. A @spell[disintegrate] spell destroys the temple
      instantly.</p><p>Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year
      makes this effect permanent.</p></div>
