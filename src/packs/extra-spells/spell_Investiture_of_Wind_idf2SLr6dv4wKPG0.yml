      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>Until the spell ends, wind whirls around
      you, and you gain the following benefits:</p><ul class="rd__list"><li
      class="rd__li ">Ranged weapon attacks made against you have disadvantage
      on the attack roll.</li><li class="rd__li ">You gain a flying speed of 60
      feet. If you are still flying when the spell ends, you fall, unless you
      can somehow prevent it.</li><li class="rd__li ">You can use your action to
      create a 15-foot cube of swirling wind centered on a point you can see
      within 60 feet of you. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution
      saving throw. A creature takes [[/damage 2d10 type=bludgeoning]] damage on
      a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Large or
      smaller creature fails the save, that creature is also pushed up to 10
      feet away from the center of the cube.</li></ul></div>
