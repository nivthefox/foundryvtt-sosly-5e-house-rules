      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You reach into the mind of one creature
      you can see and force it to make an Intelligence saving throw. A creature
      automatically succeeds if it is immune to being
      &amp;Reference[condition=frightened]. On a failed save, the target loses
      the ability to distinguish friend from foe, regarding all creatures it can
      see as enemies until the spell ends. Each time the target takes damage, it
      can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a
      success.</p><p>Whenever the affected creature chooses another creature as
      a target, it must choose the target at random from among the creatures it
      can see within range of the attack, spell, or other ability it's using. If
      an enemy provokes an opportunity attack from the affected creature, the
      creature must make that attack if it is able to.</p></div>
