      innocent bystanders to exhort and inspire them to greatness, whether they
      have anything to get excited about or not. Choose up to five creatures
      within range that can hear you. For the duration, each affected creature
      gains 5 temporary hit points and has advantage on Wisdom saving throws. If
      an affected creature is hit by an attack, it has advantage on the next
      attack roll it makes. Once an affected creature loses the temporary hit
      points granted by this spell, the spell ends for that
      creature.</p></div><div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p></p><div

      this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the temporary hit
      points increase by 5 for each slot level above 3rd.</p></div></div>
