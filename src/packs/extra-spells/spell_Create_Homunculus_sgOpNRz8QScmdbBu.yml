      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>While speaking an intricate incantation,
      you cut yourself with a jewel-encrusted dagger, taking [[/damage 2d4
      type=piercing]] damage that can't be reduced in any way. You then drip
      your blood on the spell's other components and touch them, transforming
      them into a special construct called a @creature[homunculus].</p><p>The
      statistics of the @creature[homunculus] are in the Monster Manual. It is
      your faithful companion, and it dies if you die. Whenever you finish a
      long rest, you can spend up to half your Hit Dice if the homunculus is on
      the same plane of existence as you. When you do so, roll each die and add
      your Constitution modifier to it. Your hit point maximum is reduced by the
      total, and the homunculus's hit point maximum and current hit points are
      both increased by it. This process can reduce you to no lower than 1 hit
      point, and the change to your and the homunculus's hit points ends when
      you finish your next long rest. The reduction to your hit point maximum
      can't be removed by any means before then, except by the homunculus's
      death.</p><p>You can have only one homunculus at a time. If you cast this
      spell while your homunculus lives, the spell fails.</p></div>
