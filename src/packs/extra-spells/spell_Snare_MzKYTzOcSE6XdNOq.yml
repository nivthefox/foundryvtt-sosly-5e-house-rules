      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>As you cast this spell, you use the rope
      to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When
      you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic
      trap.</p><p>This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful
      Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Investigation]) check against your
      spell save DC to be discerned.</p><p>The trap triggers when a Small,
      Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the
      spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or
      be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet
      above the ground or the floor. The creature is
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] there until the spell ends.</p><p>A
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] creature can make a Dexterity saving
      throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a
      success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can
      use an action to make an Intelligence (&amp;Reference[skill=Arcana]) check
      against your spell save DC. On a success, the
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] effect ends.</p><p>After the trap is
      triggered, the spell ends when no creature is
      &amp;Reference[condition=restrained] by it.</p></div>
