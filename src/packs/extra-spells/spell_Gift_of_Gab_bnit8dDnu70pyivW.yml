      this spell, originally calling it <i>I said what?!</i> Have you ever been
      talking to the local monarch and accidentally mentioned how their son
      looks like your favorite hog from when you were growing up on the family
      farm? We've all been there! But rather than being beheaded for an honest
      slip of the tongue, you can pretend it never happened—by ensuring that no
      one knows it happened.</p><p>When you cast this spell, you skillfully
      reshape the memories of listeners in your immediate area, so that each
      creature of your choice within 5 feet of you forgets everything you said
      within the last 6 seconds. Those creatures then remember that you actually
      said the words you speak as the verbal component of the spell.</p></div>
