      <div class="rd__b  rd__b--3"><p>You magically distract the triggering
      creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another
      creature. The triggering creature must reroll the [[/r d20]] and use the
      lower roll.</p><p>You can then choose a different creature you can see
      within range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has advantage
      on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1
      minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this spell at a
      time.</p></div>
