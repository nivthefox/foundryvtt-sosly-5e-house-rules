      <p>A heavy shield increases your Armor Class by 2. Additionally, you have
      advantage on Dexterity saving throws. When you take the Dodge action while
      wielding a heavy shield, you may also take cover behind your shield,
      gaining an additional +2 bonus to your Armor Class until the start of your
      next turn. You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Dexterity
      (Stealth) checks while wielding a heavy shield, and you cannot squeeze
      through spaces smaller than your size category.</p>
