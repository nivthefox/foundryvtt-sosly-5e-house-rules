      <p>A creature for large-area farmers, cows require large areas of flat
      grazing meaning they are not as common as other livestock. However, they
      live longer, and give far more milk. They are also a source for much more
      durable leather that is less prone to cracking and is resistant to heat
      and dirt.</p>

      <p>Depending in the gender and breed, adult cows can weigh between 1,000
      and 1,800 pounds.</p>
