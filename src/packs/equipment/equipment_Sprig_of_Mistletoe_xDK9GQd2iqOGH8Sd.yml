      <p>A hardy sprig of mistletoe, holly, or some other sacred leaf, picked
      from a tree whose roots are sunken deep into a ley line. Those who heed
      nature's call are able to harness this connection to call forth the
      incredible power of nature.</p>

      <p><strong>Spellcasting Focus</strong>. A druidic focus is a special item
      designed to channel the power of spells from the druid's spell list. A
      druid can use such an item as a spellcasting focus, using it in place of
      any material component which does not list a cost.</p>
