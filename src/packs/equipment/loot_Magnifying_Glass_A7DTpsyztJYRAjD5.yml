      <p>This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a
      substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a
      magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to
      ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass
      grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item
      that is small or highly detailed.</p>
