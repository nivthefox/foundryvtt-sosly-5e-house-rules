    value: >-
      <p>Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee attack as part of the
      Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to attempt to shove
      that target with your horns. The target must be within 5 feet of you and
      no more than one size larger than you. Unless it succeeds on a Strength
      saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your
      Strength modifier, you push it up to 10 feet away from you.</p><p></p>
