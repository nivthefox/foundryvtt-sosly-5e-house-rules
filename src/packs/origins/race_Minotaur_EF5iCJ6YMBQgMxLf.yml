      <p>The minotaurs of Krynn are a formidable warrior race who occupy the
      islands of Mithas and Kothas in the Blood Sea. Standing over seven feet
      tall with bullish features, curved horns, and fur ranging from red-brown
      to black, these massive creatures endured centuries of enslavement by
      ogres, dwarves, and the Istar Empire before claiming their independence
      after the Cataclysm sank their former oppressors beneath the
      ocean.</p><p>Driven by a belief in their destined dominance over Krynn,
      minotaurs adhere to a harsh philosophy where the strong rule and the weak
      perish. Their society is highly organized and militaristic, with warriors
      wearing leather harnesses decorated with military insignia. Despite their
      ruthless reputation and brutal laws, minotaurs are not mindless
      killersâ€”many display sophistication and thoughtfulness, and some will even
      ally with forces of good when it serves their ambitious
      purposes.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check
