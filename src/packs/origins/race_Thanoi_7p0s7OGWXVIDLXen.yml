      <p>The thanoi, or walrusfolk, are humanoid walrus hybrids inhabiting the
      frozen southern region of Icereach. Standing up to 8 feet tall with bulky
      bodies, thick protective hides, and tusks reaching 2 feet in length, these
      surprisingly agile creatures live as nomadic tribes constantly migrating
      across the barren landscape in search of hunting grounds. Their
      communities travel with trained polar bears that serve as both
      transportation for their mobile camps and war mounts in conflicts against
      the region's human barbarians and white dragons.</p><p>Most thanoi
      consider abundant food their greatest treasure, with some forgoing
      material wealth to maintain closer connections with nature. They rarely
      venture beyond Icereach, as warmer climates prove uncomfortable for their
      arctic-adapted bodies. When thanoi do leave their homeland, it's typically
      as traders or hunters who briefly visit Ansalon's southern shores before
      quickly returning. The few who remain abroad longer often return with
      tales of adventure that inspire younger generations, though these
      well-traveled individuals frequently depart again, unable to readjust to
      their isolated homeland after experiencing the wider world.RetryClaude can
