    value: >-
      <p>You are able to adopt the form of a specific beast which must be a CR
      0. As an action, you can magically assume your beast form or a hybrid
      human and animal form. You can remain in this form indefinitely, and only
      revert to your natural form when you are rendered unconscious, or with
      another action.</p><p>While you transformed into a beast, the following
      rules apply:</p><ul><li><p>Your game statistics are replaced by the
      statistics of the beast, but you retain your hit points, alignment,
      personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also
      retain all of your skill and saving throw
      proficiencies.</p></li><li><p>You can't cast spells, and your ability to
      speak or take actions which a cat may take. Transforming does not break
      your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you
      from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning that
      you've already cast.</p></li><li><p>You retain the benefit of any features
      from your class, race, or other source and can use them if your beast form
      is physically capable of doing so.</p></li><li><p>Your equipment merges
      into your new form, and has no effect until you leave the
      form.</p></li><li><p>Your Hybrid form retains the statistics of your
      humanoid form.</p></li></ul><section class="fvtt advice"><figure

      Spirit Form Automation</h3><p>When you would like to use your Animal
      Spirit Form, drag your animal sheet onto your character sheet, select the
      Wild Shape option, and Foundry will automatically update your sheet. You
      can revert the transformation at the top of your sheet or by right
      clicking on your Actor in the sidebar.</p></article></section>
