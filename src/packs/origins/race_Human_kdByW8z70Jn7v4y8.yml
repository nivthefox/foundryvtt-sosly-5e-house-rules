      <p>Found throughout the multiverse, humans are as varied as they are
      numerous, and they endeavor to achieve as much as they can in the years
      they are given. Their ambition and resourcefulness are commended,
      respected, and feared on many worlds.</p><p>Humans are as diverse in
      appearance as the people of Earth, and they have many gods. Scholars
      dispute the origin of humanity, but one of the earliest known human
      gatherings is said to have occurred in Sigil, the torus-shaped city at the
      center of the multiverse and the place where the Common language was born.
      From there, humans could have spread to every part of the multiverse,
      bringing the City of Doors’ cosmopolitanism with them.</p><h3
