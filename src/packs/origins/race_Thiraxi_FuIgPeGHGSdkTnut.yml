      <p>The Thiraxi are the native sentient species of Erdyr, born of the
      world's ancient soil and deeply attuned to its rhythms. When followers of
      the lost god Adrair arrived thousands of years ago, the Thiraxi were
      driven from their ancestral lands into remote wastes and deep jungles. To
      this day, many Thiraxi refer to these invaders as the "Godless Ones"—a
      title that carries bitter irony in a world now abandoned by all
      gods.</p><p>Thiraxi society is tribal and semi-nomadic, building
      labyrinthine stone sanctuaries underground or into cliff faces where
      silence is law and psychic echoes carry between minds. They wield psionic
      abilities through ritual and meditation, viewing these mental gifts not as
      blessings but as necessary burdens that must be carefully balanced. Elders
      known as Mind-Weavers serve as leaders and judges, mediating disputes
      through trance states where the thoughts of all involved are laid
      bare.</p><p>The Thiraxi are tall, lithe beings with semi-translucent skin
      that glows in bioluminescent hues reflecting their emotions. They have
      large black eyes adapted to low light, long limb proportions, and delicate
      crown-like ridges of keratin resembling antlers or coral.</p><h3>Thiraxi
