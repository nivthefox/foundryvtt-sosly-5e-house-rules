      attention of the Mages of High Sorcery, an organization of spellcasters
      that studies magic and prevents its misuse. You’ve trained among the
      Mages, but whether you’ll face the dangerous test required to become a
      full member of the group remains to be determined. Your passion for
      studying magic has likely already predisposed you toward one of the
      organization’s three orders: the benevolent Order of the White Robes, the
      balance-pursuing Order of the Red Robes, or the ruthless Order of the
      Black Robes.</p><p>In the world of Krynn, many refer to the Mages of High
      Sorcery as the Wizards of High Sorcery. The organization accepts more than
      wizards, though, with sorcerers, warlocks, and other spellcasters included
      among their ranks.</p><p></p>

        Your background allows you to increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, and
        Charisma scores; increase one of them by 2 and a different one by 1, or
        increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above
        20.
