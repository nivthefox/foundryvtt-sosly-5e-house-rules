    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you plant the phantom of a greatly desired object in a creature's mind. Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, you gain partial control over the target's behavior until your concentration ends; the target moves as you wish on each of its turns, as it thinks it pursues the phantom object it desires. If it hasn't taken damage since its last turn, it can use its action only to admire the object you created in its perception. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
      <!-- TODO: Review implementation of "you gain partial control over the target's behavior - the target moves as you wish on each of its turns" and "if it hasn't taken damage since its last turn, it can use its action only to admire the object" - These mind-control and action restriction effects are not implemented via active effects and require manual enforcement or DM adjudication. -->
