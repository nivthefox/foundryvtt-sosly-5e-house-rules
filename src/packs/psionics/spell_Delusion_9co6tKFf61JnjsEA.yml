    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you plant a false belief in the mind of one creature that
      you can see within 60 feet of you. You can create a sound or an image.
      Only the target of this talent perceives the sound or image you
      create.</p> <p>If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper
      to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a creature's
      roar, a musical instrument, or any other sound you pick. It lasts for 1
      minute.</p> <p>If you create an object, it must fit within a 5-foot cube
      and can't move or be reflective. The image can't create any effect that
      influences a sense other than sight. The image lasts for 1 minute, and it
      disappears if the creature touches it.</p>
