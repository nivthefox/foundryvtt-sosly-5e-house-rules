    value: >-
      <p>As an action, choose up to eight creatures you can see within 90 feet of you that can see you. At the start of each of a target's turns before your concentration ends, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is &Reference[condition=frightened] until the start of its next turn, and you roll a die. If you roll an odd number, the frightened target moves half its speed in a random direction and takes no action on that turn, other than to scream in terror. If you roll an even number, the frightened target makes one melee attack against a random target within its reach. If there is no such target, it moves half its speed in a random direction and takes no action on that turn. This effect ends on a target if it succeeds on three saving throws against it.</p>
      <p><!-- TODO: Review implementation of panic effects. The random movement, forced attacks, and three-success tracking may require additional automation or manual tracking. --></p>
