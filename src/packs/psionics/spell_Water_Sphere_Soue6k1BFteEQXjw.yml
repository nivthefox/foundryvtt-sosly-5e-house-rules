    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you cause a sphere of water to form around a creature. Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes trapped in the sphere of water until your concentration ends. While the target is trapped, its speed is halved, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls, and it can't see anything more than 10 feet away from it. However, attack rolls against it also suffer disadvantage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
      <p><!-- TODO: Review implementation - disadvantage on attack rolls by and against the target requires manual tracking, as does vision limitation to 10 feet --></p>
