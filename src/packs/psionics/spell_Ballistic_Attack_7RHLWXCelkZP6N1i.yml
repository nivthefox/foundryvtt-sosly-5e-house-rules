    value: >-
      <p>As an action, choose an object weighing up to 5 pounds within 150 feet
      that isn't being worn or carried by another creature. Make a ranged
      discipline attack roll against a creature within 90 feet that you can see.
      The object flies toward the creature, dealing 1d8 damage on a hit, or
      passing it harmlessly on a miss. The damage type is either bludgeoning,
      piercing, or slashing, depending on the type of object thrown.</p> <p>The
      talent's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th
      level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). The weight limit increases by 5 pounds
      when you reach 5th level (10 pounds), 11th level (15 pounds), and 17th
      level (20 pounds).</p>
