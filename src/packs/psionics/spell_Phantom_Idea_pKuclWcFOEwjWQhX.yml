    value: >-
      <p>While you concentrate on this ability, you probe one creature's mind.
      The creature must remain within 30 feet of you, and you must be able to
      see it. If you reach the ability's full duration, the target must make
      three Intelligence saving throws, and you plant information from it based
      on the number of saving throws it fails. You choose whether the idea or
      memory is trivial (such as "I had porridge for breakfast" or "Ale is the
      worst") or personality-defining ("I failed to save my village from an orc
      marauders and am therefore a coward" or "Magic is a scourge, so I renounce
      it").</p> <p>With one failed saving throw, the idea or memory lasts for
      the next 4 hours.</p> <p>With two failed saving throws, the idea or memory
      lasts for the next 24 hours.</p> <p>With three failed saving throws, the
      idea or memory lasts for the next 48 hours.</p> <p><!-- TODO: Review
      implementation of three separate saving throws mechanic and memory
      implantation duration - this is a complex interaction that may need GM
      adjudication --></p>
