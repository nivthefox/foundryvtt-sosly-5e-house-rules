    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you ask a question of one creature that can see and hear
      you within 30 feet of you. The question must be phrased so that it can be
      answered with a yes or no, otherwise this ability fails. The target must
      succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it replies with a truthful answer. A
      creature is immune to this ability if it is immune to being charmed.</p>
