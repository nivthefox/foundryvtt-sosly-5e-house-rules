    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you exert an aura that inspires awe in others. Choose up
      to 5 creatures you can see within 60 feet of you. Each target must succeed
      on an Intelligence saving throw or be charmed by you until your
      concentration ends. While charmed, the target obeys all your verbal
      commands to the best of its ability and without doing anything obviously
      self-destructive. The charmed target will attack only creatures that it
      has seen attack or harm you since it was charmed or that it was already
      hostile toward. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving
      throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.</p>
