    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you cast the <em>silent image</em> spell.</p>
      <p><strong>Silent Image (1st-level Illusion Spell):</strong> You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted, but it is an illusion that occupies its space. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion. A creature that takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. When a creature discerns the image for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p>
      <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10 minutes (Concentration)</p>
      <p><strong>Range:</strong> 60 feet</p>
