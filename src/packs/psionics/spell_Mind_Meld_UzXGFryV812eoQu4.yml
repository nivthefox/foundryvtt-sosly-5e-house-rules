  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a bonus action, you can communicate telepathically with one creature
      you can see within 120 feet of you. The target must have an Intelligence
      score of at least 2, otherwise this talent fails and the action is
      wasted.</p> <p>You don't need to share a language with the target for it
      to understand your telepathic utterances, and it understands you even if
      it lacks a language. You can allow the target to respond to you
      telepathically, but it must understand at least one language in order to
      communicate this way. Alternatively, you can gain access to one memory of
      the target's choice, gaining perfect recall of one thing it saw or did.
      This communication can occur until the end of the current turn.</p>
