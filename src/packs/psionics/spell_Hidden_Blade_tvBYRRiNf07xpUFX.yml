  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As a bonus action, you cause one simple or martial melee weapon you are
      holding to dissolve into your body. This process is harmless to you and
      the weapon. Until the weapon reappears, it is inaccessible, as are any of
      its properties. You can have only one weapon at a time affected in this
      way.</p> <p>You can summon the weapon to your hand as a bonus action. It
      reappears in your space if you are unconscious or dead.</p>
