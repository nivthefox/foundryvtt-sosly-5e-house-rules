    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you plant delusional paranoia in a creature's mind. Choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw, or until your concentration ends, it must target its allies with attacks and other damaging effects. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature is immune to this ability if it is immune to being &Reference[condition=charmed].</p>
      <!-- TODO: Review implementation of "must target its allies with attacks and other damaging effects" - This mind-control effect is not implemented via active effects and requires manual enforcement or DM adjudication. -->
