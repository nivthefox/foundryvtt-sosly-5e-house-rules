      <p>After 1 hour of uninterrupted meditation, you project your astral body
      into the Astral Plane (the effect fails and the psi points are wasted if
      either of you can't fit in the destination space). The material body you
      leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it
      doesn't need food or air and doesn't age.</p>

      <p>Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way,
      replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference
      is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder
      blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This
      cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains
      intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can
      happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and
      body are separated, killing you instantly.</p>

      <p>Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can
      pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new
      plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your
      body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you
      to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a
      separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no
      effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to
      it.</p>

      <p>The effect ends when you use your action to dismiss it. When the effect
      ends, your affected self returns to your physical body, and you
      awaken.</p>

      <p>The effect might also end early. A successful <em>dispel magic</em>
      spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell on that
      creature. If your original body or your astral form drops to 0 hit points,
      the effect ends. If the effect ends and the silver cord is intact, the
      cord pulls your astral form back to your body, ending your state of
      suspended animation.</p>

      <p>If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in
      their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies,
      usually by dropping to 0 hit points.</p>
