    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you try to grasp one creature you can see within 120 feet
      of you, with a hand crafted from telekinetic energy. The target must
      succeed on a Strength saving throw or take 1d6 force damage. If it takes
      any of this damage and is Large or smaller, you can move it up to 10 feet
      in a straight line in a direction of your choice. You can't lift the
      target off the ground unless it is already airborne or underwater.</p>

      <p>This talent's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6),
      11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).</p>
