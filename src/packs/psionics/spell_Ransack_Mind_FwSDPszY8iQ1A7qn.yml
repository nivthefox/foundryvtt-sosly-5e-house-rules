    value: >-
      <p>While you concentrate on this ability, you probe one creature's mind.
      The creature must remain within 30 feet of you, and you must be able to
      see it. If you reach the ability's full duration, the target must make
      three Intelligence saving throws, and you learn information from it based
      on the number of saving throws it fails.</p> <p>With one failed saving
      throw, you learn its key memories from the past 12 hours.</p> <p>With two
      failed saving throws, you learn its key memories from the past 24
      hours.</p> <p>With three failed saving throws, you learn its key memories
      from the past 48 hours.</p> <p><!-- TODO: Review implementation of three
      separate saving throws mechanic and memory extraction - this is a complex
      interaction that may need GM adjudication --></p>
