    value: >-
      <p>If you haven't moved yet on your turn, choose an ally you can see within 60 feet of you. As a bonus action, you and that creature teleport, swapping places, and your speed is reduced to 0 until the end of the turn. This ability fails and is wasted if either of you can't fit in the destination space.</p>
      <p><!-- TODO: Review implementation - teleportation swap is manual, speed reduction must be tracked by player --></p>
