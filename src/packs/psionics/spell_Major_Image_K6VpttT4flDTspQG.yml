    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you cast the <em>major image</em> spell.</p>
      <p><strong>Major Image (3rd-level Illusion Spell):</strong> You create the
      image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is
      no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can
      see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real,
      including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing
      depicted. You can't create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a
      sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell
      that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte's stench). Physical
      interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion. A creature that
      takes a Study action to examine the image can determine that it is an
      illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
      spell save DC. When a creature discerns the image for what it is, the
      creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become
      faint to the creature.</p> <p>As long as you are within range of the
      illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other
      spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its
      appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For
      example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter
      the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the
      illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry
      on a conversation, for example.</p> <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 10
      minutes (Concentration)</p> <p><strong>Range:</strong> 120 feet</p>
