    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you slip out of time until the start of your next turn.
      Roll a d20 at the end of each of your turns. On a roll of 11 or higher,
      you slip out of time until the start of your next turn once more.</p>
      <p>You can dismiss this effect as an action.</p> <p>While you are out of
      time, you can't see anything more than 60 feet away, which is cast in
      shades of gray. You cannot affect or be affected by other creatures, and
      they can't perceive you unless they have truesight.</p> <p><!-- TODO:
      Review implementation - Phasing mechanics (out of time state, vision
      limitations, immunity to effects, d20 roll to continue) must be tracked
      manually by player and DM. This power creates a unique phasing state
      similar to the Ethereal Plane. --></p>
