    value: >-
      <p>You cause a creature to regard all other beings as horrid, alien
      entities. As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet of
      you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it
      takes 5d6 psychic damage, and until your concentration ends, it takes 1d6
      psychic damage per creature within 5 feet of it at the end of each of its
      turns. On a successful save, the target takes only half the initial damage
      and suffers none of the other effects.</p> <!-- TODO: Review
      implementation of ongoing damage per nearby creature - The ongoing "1d6
      psychic damage per creature within 5 feet" effect at the end of each turn
      is not implemented via active effects and requires manual tracking or
      custom automation. -->
