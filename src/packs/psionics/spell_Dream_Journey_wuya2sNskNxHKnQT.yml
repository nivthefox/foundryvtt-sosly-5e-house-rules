      <p>By spending 1 minute in uninterrupted meditation, you cast the
      <em>dream</em> spell.</p>

      <p><strong>Dream (5th-level illusion):</strong> This spell shapes a
      creature's dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this
      spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures
      that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be contacted by this spell. You, or
      a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a
      messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of their
      surroundings, but can't take actions or move.</p>

      <p>If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target's dreams
      and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the
      duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the
      dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can
      emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early.
      The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake
      when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the
      trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which
      point the messenger appears in the target's dreams.</p>

      <p>You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the
      target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten
      words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
      save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts
      the duration of the target's sleep and prevents the target from gaining
      any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it
      takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p>
