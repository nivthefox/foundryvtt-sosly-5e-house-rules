    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you create an invisible, insubstantial wall of energy
      within 60 feet of you that is up to 30 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot
      thick. The wall lasts until your concentration ends. Any creature
      attempting to move through it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed
      save, a creature can't move through the wall until the start of its next
      turn. On a successful save, the creature can pass through it. A creature
      must make this save whenever it attempts to pass through the wall, whether
      willingly or unwillingly.</p> <!-- TODO: Review implementation of wall
      blocking movement - This effect requires manual enforcement or special
      wall token handling. The save activity represents the saving throw but
      blocking movement is not automated. -->
