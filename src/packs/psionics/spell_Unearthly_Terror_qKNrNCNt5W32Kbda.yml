    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you bombard a creature within 60 feet with horrifying images, causing them to be shaken. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. A creature that is immune to being frightened is unaffected.</p>

      <p>This talent's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).</p>

      <!-- TODO: Review implementation of "disadvantage on next attack roll" - This effect is not implemented via active effects and needs manual enforcement or additional automation. -->
