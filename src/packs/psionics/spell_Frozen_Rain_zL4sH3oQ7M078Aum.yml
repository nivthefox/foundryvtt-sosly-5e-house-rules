  description:
    value: >-
      <p>As an action, choose a point you can see within 120 feet of you. The
      air in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point becomes deathly cold
      and saturated with moisture. Each creature in that area must make a
      Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 6d6 cold
      damage, and its speed is reduced to 0 until your concentration ends. On a
      successful save, a target takes half as much damage.</p>

      <p>As an action, a target that has its speed reduced can end the effect
      early if it succeeds on a Strength check against your discipline save
      DC.</p>

      <p>You can increase this effect's damage by 1d6 per each additional psi
      point spent on it.</p>

      <!-- TODO: Review implementation of speed reduction to 0 and Strength
      check to break free mechanics -->
