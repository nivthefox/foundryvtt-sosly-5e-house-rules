    value: >-
      <p>As an action, you throw your weapon into the air and choose a point
      within 120 feet. Hundreds of spectral duplicates of your weapon fall like
      rain in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high cylinder centered on that point.
      Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
      creature takes 8d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
      successful one. The damage type is the same as that of the weapon, and the
      weapon immediately returns to your hand.</p>

      <p><!-- TODO: Review implementation of damage type - "The damage type is
      the same as that of the weapon" may require manual selection or active
      effect configuration. Currently set to slashing as default. --></p>
